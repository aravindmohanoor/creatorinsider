Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=0) |  - All right insiders, we are back

and as ever, I want to start out by going through a couple of learnings from my side. So in reviewing your comments, I now know that I need to be very careful of lip smacking, so thank you very much for that tip, NemRaps. And in other news, I got some great feedback that I actually wasn't looking at the camera lens, I was looking at myself, so from now on I will be looking directly at you rather than myself  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=30) |  for the coming videos, so thanks to

everybody who's leaving me these comments, it's allowing me to learn more and more about all of the lessons that you have learned on how you're making your channel successful. And if anybody gets a chance, take a look at NemRaps' channel because it is delightful. All right, first update, most watched playlists. What we've heard from creators is that what you really want  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=60) |  is a way to analyze your channel

across different content types and themes. Now, we're working on an experiment which would be a new card, which would give you a snapshot of watch time segmented by theme. So for example, with Creator Insider, what we've noticed is a huge amount of watch time comes from the search and discovery theme, really valuable information. One point to note is that while we were initially planning to populate the themes based on the playlists that creators had already created,

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=90) |  the actual views that we'll be looking

at through this card will be from the watch time across your entire channel, not just from the playlists themselves. And I hear you ask, "Connor, this sounds great, how do I get involved, how do I get to be part of the experiment?". Well, two conditions, you need to have at least four playlists each with three or four videos that are from your own channel and not just a playlist that's created  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=120) |  from other people's channels. And if you

fall into that category, leave us a comment and say, as ever, "Hey, I want to be part of the experiment", throw in as many fun emojis as you want, you know how much of a fan I am of those. So watch out for that and make sure to leave us a comment if you want to be part of it. Okay, next update is around our verification badge process. Now, a couple of months ago, we opened up a form that allowed creators with over 100,000 subscribers  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=150) |  to apply for a verified badge. Now

our help center details the types of things we look for when we're processing these applications. The two main signals are, number one that the channel is complete, and the main signifiers there are that it has a channel banner and it has public uploads, and the second is that it is authentic, it is the person, band or artist that it claims to be. Now the update here is that we've had delays in this processing of the applications,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=180) |  we're working through those as quickly as

we can, but bear with us and we'll come back to you as soon as possible. Next up, we have some exciting news around Studio permissions. We have a new permissions role within Studio called editor without access to revenue data, something that has long been called for. On top of this, we're delivering some functionality that should have been there at the outset, things like end screens, info cards, and pretty soon, captions. Now, if you're a brand account, you can simply opt in,

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=210) |  there's one thing to keep in mind.

There are differences in features available between the level of access in permissions and brand accounts. For example, permissions only work on Studio desktop for the moment, so what you'll want to do is have a poke around, see what features are available in permissions before you start using that instead of the brand account. Now, we're hoping to add more roles as the months progress this year,  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=240) |  so keep us updated with what's working

for you and what more you would like to see, leave a comment beneath the video. Next up, the deprecation of poll cards. Now a few weeks ago, we outlined that these would be deprecated, we heard some really good feedback and after thoughtful deliberation, we're going to discontinue poll cards starting from June 10th. Now, why are we doing this? It's because there was low usage, less than 0.2% of channels who uploaded a video this year used poll cards,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=270) |  so that's why we want to set

that aside and focus on other great tools to help creators. Now, you still want to test the sentiment of your audience, so you can use things like audience comments, and, of course, the freely available Google Forms. And if you are a YouTuber with over 1,000 subscribers, you can still use the poll feature within your Community tab. Next up, we have Creators on the Rise, what is this? Well, it's featuring emerging creators on the Trending tab for 24 hours.

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=300) |  What's the news? Well, we're expanding into

three new countries, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, you are in. How do you apply? Well, there's no application process. What's gonna happen is, you're gonna get a Creators on the Rise blue badge that will appear beside your channel name when you've been selected, how are they selected? Well, the YouTube team takes into account a number of different factors. The first one is view count, followed by watch time growth,  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=330) |  followed by frequency of upload. So when

you're selected, you'll see that badge beside your channel, we're really excited to be supporting emerging creators. All right, last update we have is around the comments experience in community posts. So in February of this year, what we did was announce some great improvements to the experience, those were things like replies to comment replies, sort comments by newest first, nice, comment pinning and comment management in Studio, all great stuff, gets even better.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=360) |  Not only are these live for posts

from February 2020 onwards, they're now live for all historical posts as well. I bet you're thinking, this can't get any better, well, I have news for you, we're about to move to trivia. Last week's question was, in what year did YouTube first serve an ad? And the answer, the correct answer was 2007 and the winner this week was the follicly challenged Mr. Bald Gamer,  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=390) |  round of applause please, clap clap. Okay,

so this week's trivia question is, which music video was the fastest to reach one billion views on the platform? Now remember, not necessarily the first, but the fastest. Leave your suggestions, answers, comments  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7-s5rAWygI&t=420) |  in the comments underneath this video, and

I will be scrolling through those over the coming week, reading your feedback and also picking the winner of the trivia question. So have a great week and we'll talk to you next week.

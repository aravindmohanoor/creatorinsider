#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=0) |  - Hey Insiders, we're back with another

edition of News Flash, bringing you the best of YouTube's updates just the way you like them. Direct and to the point. And I know you'd like things direct and to the point because I read through all the comments on last week's video, and you provided some excellent feedback. Number one, the audio quality was pretty terrible, which is why we have this bad boy now. The echo was pretty annoying, and you all had to turn up your volumes. And so you can't see it now,  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=30) |  but there's not a lot of sound

insulation around me. So that's gonna inform the way News Flash is going forward. So let's get into it. First update is around the uploads escape hatch. That's something that was removed on June 22. And that completes the migration of the uploads flow from classic to studio. Something Tom would be really proud of. We have the news you've all been waiting for, which is latency improvements when it comes to the watch time from Impressions Report within the Funnel Report itself.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=60) |  Hope you got my joke about news

you've all been waiting for on latency improvements? Okay, let's get into it. And so for creators, what had been happening up until now is that you had to wait up to two days after publication in order to see that updated Funnel Report. And this is in spite of the fact that you already had some metrics in terms of impressions and click through rate. But we've always been waiting on the slowest metric, which is watch time from impressions to actually come in.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=90) |  With this change, we hope creators will

see the information up-to-date after a better day rather than the full two, and this should also resolve some inconsistencies that you might see within the Reach tab in channel analytics. Next up we have some alerts for merch purchases in live chat. That's right. This is a new launch. A couple of news flashes ago we introduced this as a mini-sneak peek to the Creator Insider nation.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=120) |  But now we're going for full launch.

So what this means is that for creators who use, you know, Teespring and live streaming on YouTube, what you will see, same as everybody else, is an alert pop up when anybody purchases some of your merch. So what we hope is this will increase some of the buzz around your merch, as well as your content. All good things for creators, and you don't have to do a thing. And next up, we're bringing back the other Connor with two ends to give us some insights

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=150) |  from unlisted video review. Now, Jenny sat

down with Tom a couple of weeks ago to go through exactly what unlisted video review is. So if you need more context to take a scan back and watch that video again. But every couple of weeks, Connor is gonna be coming back and giving us some insights about the learnings that the policy team are taking away-- - Hi Everybody. This week's insight is around the topic of violence and shocking content.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=180) |  So starting at a high level, violent

or gory content that is intended to shock or disgust viewers, and content that encourages others to commit violent acts, are not allowed on YouTube. Content including violence that has clear educational documentary, scientific or artistic intent and context, such as a news broadcast about a violent event is generally allowable on YouTube, but may not be appropriate for all audiences. We treat dramatize violence, such as a fight scene and an action movie,  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=210) |  or the use of weapons in a

video game slightly differently than we would quote unquote real world violence. So for example, violence that occurs in standard video gameplay would be suitable for monetization so long as it does not contain graphic scenes. Some examples of that might be, people being dismembered or just decapitated, human corpses with severe injuries, that sort of thing. One concept to keep in mind is intent.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=240) |  So an example would be, a compilation

video of graphic violence. Whether that's real world, or from a video game, from a movie or otherwise would not be suitable for monetization and may not be allowed on YouTube at all, depending on the context and because the intent there is to shock or horrify the audience. Okay, I have one last example for you. And this one doesn't squarely fit in what most of us think of, at least right away when it comes to the word violence. But let's talk about injuries and specifically,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=270) |  injuries that might take place in something

like a sporting event. A video focusing on graphic injuries, say, a compilation of many different injuries across a number of events, likely it would be removed from the platform, while on the other hand, a news coverage with clear explanation of the situation, maybe a specific sporting injury, if it had the correct context surrounding it, would likely be allowed on the platform. But depending on the level of injury sustained, maybe age restricted

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=300) |  So this is a good example of

one that may not immediately come to mind when you think of our violence policies. But it's important to keep in mind along with all the rest. So yeah, that's our insight for you this week, I'm looking forward to seeing you again next time. - Thanks, Connor. Next up, we have some really great news for anyone who's wondering how YouTube works. That's pretty much all of us. But what we've done is, on the 25th of June, so just a couple of days ago,  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=330) |  we launched a site called How YouTube

Works. Now what this site does, is go through a couple of answers around and policies and product features that have been really common over the past couple of months. This is gonna be updated on a constant basis. So if you're looking for another area where YouTube is trying to be more transparent with you, this will be it. You can find a link in the description. We have another cameo this time from Lucas. The famous PM from the audio library is gonna be joining us for yet another cameo.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=360) |  Seems like everybody's trying to steal my

show. He's gonna be walking us through some updates with regard to the Audio Library in studio. Take it away Lucas. - Get your creator insider swag, everyone. Hey, this is Lucas, I'm here to talk about our Audio Library. For those of you who don't know, this is a resource we've had in Classic Studio for quite some time. There's thousands of free copyright safe songs for you to use in your video in there. They're all set up with our content ID system  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=390) |  so that if you use them, you

can be sure you're not going to get copyright claims and everything is monetization safe if you're eligible to monetize your videos. We are getting ready to launch the new version of this in the new Creative Studio. We started with a little experimental release a few weeks ago and we got some great feedback from you guys when we did that. So we made some tweaks and now we're getting ready to start rolling it out fully. So I want to give you a little tour of what's in there and what you'll be able to do. So first off, we made it a lot easier to find.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=420) |  It's right here in the left nav

bar of your channel in studio. When you go in there, you'll see that we have this simple table that you can search, you can filter. And there's a few key things in here that I wanna mention. So first of all, we have this new column where it shows you the date that we've added new tracks. We add new tracks every month and this list is sorted by default to show you the the tracks that were most recently added. You can search by keyword, song title,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=450) |  or artists name up here, just like

you were able to in the old version of the library. But we've added an updated Filter menu that you can use too and you can choose one filter or several filters and kind of drill down a list of things to look at. When you preview tracks, the player appears at the bottom here, and that lets you keep scrolling through the list as you're listening to stuff. And then you can also use these arrows to skip backward and forward through your tracks.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQ2hxZmF4gE/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=480) |  So let's say you find a particular

song and there's some dimension of it that you wanna drill in on further like you like this particular artist or whatever. You can click on this inline filter, and that will actually filter the list further from within the results that are showing to show you just stuff from that artist, or you can do the same thing by moot. So that's a really useful inline and filter feature. That's new. You can also as always download the song  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=510) |  and use that in your own editing

software on your computer. And very soon you'll be able to access this stuff in the editor and in studio as well and use the full library and add things directly into your your videos. There are a couple things that we're still in the process of bringing over which I wanna quickly walk through. So if you're using it and you notice that something is missing, you can really easily get back to the classic version of the library via this link in the upper-right-hand corner.  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=540) |  So for example, we're still moving over

sound effects, and soon there'll be a dedicated tab here where you can browse through and download sound effects. You'll also notice that songs that are under the Creative Commons license are not in here yet. These include songs from some popular audio library artists like Kevin MacLeod. They'll be added soon here as well and we're gonna have some improvements that make it easier to use them under the Creative Commons terms.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=570) |  And we'll say more about that when

that happens. So we really hope you enjoy using the Audio Library for your videos. It's a really great, safe, free option for finding music. Please do send us your feedback. There's inproduct tool that you can use to submit your comments and questions and ideas to us. We really do look at this stuff to inform our plans, so let us know what you like, what you don't like, any ideas you have about what we should do in the future. Alright, that's it for now. Thanks.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=600) |  - That's it. We are done with

another week of the News Flash. Before we go, I want to announce the winner of last week's trivia question which was, which famous alcoholic beverage has been described as the wine of Ireland? And of course, that was Guinness. And I wanna congratulate Bald Gamer, and toast him for hopping into those comments as fast as he did. So, next week's trivia question is, which video on the platform reached one million views first?  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2hxZmF4gE&t=630) |  So if you can jump in with

a general idea of what the concept was, who the publisher was, or ideally a link to the video itself, we will announce the winner. For my part, thanks so much for all of the really productive feedback in the comments from last week. Keep on providing it and we'll keep on making improvements such as this nifty mic. Thanks so much.

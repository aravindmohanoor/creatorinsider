#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=0) |  hello insiders this week we have a

special sneak peak with a very special guest Jenni welcome to the show thank you thanks for having me you have been working on something that we've been talking about in the company for a little while now with great interest but this is gonna be the first time I think we've talked about what you're working on more openly publicly yeah and I think the audience is gonna be curious to hear what you've been up to well I'm excited  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=30) |  to share because it's definitely been something

that we've been hearing from creators a lot and you know something that we can see is hopefully depending on how Korea is respond and react to it an opportunity for us to do a better job and get a little bit more insight into places where creators need help what have you been up to what is this what is this project what is this thing I mean working on program called the unlisted video review program lluvia very short so catchy so catchy it's a  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=60) |  small pilot program uh-huh where were helping

creators do just as the time of the scribes get their unlisted videos reviewed not interesting so this we we currently tell creators to upload a video put it as unlisted see if the yellow icon comes on if it does then appeal but what you're doing is a little more little different than that it's it's kind of an addition to that okay so  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=90) |  what we realized was you know you

have this kind of workflow I'm uploading being able to appeal but you don't always get full diagnosis of your video for why you may run into a yellow icon gross so what we're doing is similar to add workflow we are looking at your video from a monitor station perspective as well as from a Community Guidelines perspective making sure you're not gonna run into any age restrictions we'll take a look at your video and actually send it to human reviewers so they're able to take a look at that similar to what  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=120) |  would happen if you appealed for your

yellow icon Wow Wow okay so let me just make sure I understand this currently the processes you uploaded you see yellow icon housing appeal what you're talking about is you upload it you'll get a review from a monetization point of view whether the yellow icon coming out it sounds like you might even get some more insight as to why yep then you're also gonna give some information around whether or not there's anything

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=150) |  wrong for Community Guidelines but what about

copyright you do copyright as well you don't do copyright again so like have we been doing this or is this like an idea that we're just starting like what's where we at this is an idea that we're just starting we've only unblurred a few creators and we're still iterating on the process to make sure that we're providing you know guidance service and seeing if this is something that the creator's want and that's actually helpful so how does it like what have they been telling you these panful lab and trying it out so the few  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=180) |  that have been trying it out I've

definitely been finding the insights helpful so not having to appeal not having to go through that process and also actually getting some guidance into what was the cause for that you like on I mean you might have some general idea you've read through the advertiser friend guidelines and see oh my video does have profanities so maybe that's what it was but actually being able to say okay you know your video has a bunch  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=210) |  of profanity in it here's where there's

gonna be issues that's what creators have found most helpful from the program so far Wow so then yes so they basically if they can understand what were the drivers of the issues not only does that help them I guess address it for the video that they were about to publish but I guess it also makes them kind of more successful for subsequent videos because they can kind of calibrate to what where these guidelines really mean exactly and  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=240) |  after you've kind of submitted a few

videos to us you've got a better sense of them oh where am I coming up against the line ROI and what policies do I really need to kind of dive into and better understand so that you know I don't run into those issues in the future okay so the first thing that comes to mind is like wow that sounds amazing the other thing that comes to mind is like wait a minute we have like 500 hours of video uploaded every how are we gonna have like you sit down with every creator pilot so far and the  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=270) |  other big thing about this too is

we're trying to take learnings from this hmm and then make them even more scaled in what we what we find so do we see you know a lot of creators are struggling with our profanity policies and we need to be more clear or give better you know guidance chip creators beforehand right and what-what from this are we learning about where creators are having the most problems interesting so not only is it good for these craters are in the pilot but then it helps us make  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=300) |  better policies that maybe kind of enhance

and optimize how we do things then that benefits everybody right so where are we with this project is this like are you planning on broadening availability of it and whose gets cuz I'm sure everybody watching this is gonna be like yes please yeah so I mean we have some questions you know for your viewers to kind of figure out okay is this something that you would potentially be interested in and what of this sounds like a good fit for you the

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=330) |  other element here is you know would

this be something that you'd be interested in paying for because right now it obviously takes a lot of human hours to make this thing work yeah which is you know a tough challenge for us to kind of deal with so that's why we can't open up the floodgates for it as I'm yet about we're hoping to get feedback that's if this is something that creators would be interested in in having okay let me preempt the comments right now so someone's gonna say what in a minute  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=360) |  wait a minute I'm gonna pay you

to to tell me how to navigate this crazy guidelines like what the heck is that like why are they trying to profit off of my suffering and confusion that's fair I mean I think that the the answer to that is you know to your point 500 I see so much video content uploaded at all times we can't necessarily get that in front of a human as fast as with a bike and the extra step of providing  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=390) |  that individual diagnosis it's it's an extra

layer of support you know so that's where I kind of just premium service comes in that makes sense I suppose in the long run we will try to automate as much of this as me absolutely and that's the ultimate role is that our system no hit it out of the park every time yeah but we understand it right now there's some things that they still make mistakes on it we want to make sure that we're learning from that with each of the channels that are  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=420) |  in this program and then I guess

on top of that like we are working on the new upload flow like this pre-flight check right it's not going to be nearly as good as like a human personally looking your thing but I think a lot of the insights that you guys have are finding their way into our design of the pre-flight check kind of upload improvements that we have kind of coming later this year exactly so I guess maybe this program is not meant to be like hey this is the new way to upload at YouTube right it's more  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=450) |  like this is like the the tip

of the spear in terms of us kind of improving the systems exactly we then make it more scalable and free for everybody yep through technology but if you want to participate right and it's worth it for you right then you can do that if you that might be an option exactly so what are you talking about is this like how much how much money what does it cause this is kind of like is  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=480) |  this something that creators would want to

pay for I think that's more of a question that we're at right now in figuring out you know if this is something that the creators would be willing to to spend money on but we don't have an exact number yet interesting yeah my guess and you know folks out there please leave in the comments what you think my guesses are that someone's making a decent amount of money on YouTube that there's probably a number where this makes sense for them yeah where it's like you know what just  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPUU8iujKOE/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=510) |  having more certainty and reducing the likelihood

of being of getting like finding out about the monetization too late because sometimes when you do the unlisted it catches it a lot of times but it doesn't I'm guessing you guys would maybe do more diagnosis exactly yeah yep and making sure you know we've come through and looked in it from all angles so then you know it would be pretty unlikely that you would see any change you know in that rating down the road  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=540) |  interesting no what other do you have

any other questions that you're curious about that you want to get the insider nation's feedback on yeah I mean I think the other question would be you know what types of creators that are out there are interested in this we've talked a little bit about yellow icon but we're also helping with you know age restrictions and strikes and so in that respect you know we're checking and looking at your thumbnail to make sure that it wouldn't run into any issues like that so things like that  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=570) |  what other what items would you be

interested in seeing in a program like this that takes a look at your unlisted videos and any and you know thoughts on that would be it would be super helpful awesome well I think people will be really interested in giving feedback on this one and so definitely leave them in the comments because you will read the comments yes video absolutely awesome well thank you Jenny for sharing I think what you're doing is super exciting and even for the creators that don't  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=600) |  participate in this program have no fear

because I know my team that's working on the new upload pre-flight check is working very closely with your teaming out to try and automate as much of that as possible so that it can be broadly available absolutely but I know what you guys are doing is kind of at the state of the art so very excited to see how that project evolves and grows and maybe we'll get you back on the show to get to give us an update as time goes on  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=630) |  that'd be great cool awesome keep it

real and low insiders hope you found this discussion I had with Jenny interesting I wanted to clarify some important criteria about the pilot first is it takes human reviewers up to six hours during business hours to actually do the review second is that at the moment there's no weekend support third the pilot is  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPUU8iujKOE&t=660) |  current we English only and forth the

creator's chosen for the initial pilot were folks who frequently bump up against our policies and see yellow icons often we're not expanding the program at this time but we will circle back with the ci nation as soon as we have more information to share keep it real

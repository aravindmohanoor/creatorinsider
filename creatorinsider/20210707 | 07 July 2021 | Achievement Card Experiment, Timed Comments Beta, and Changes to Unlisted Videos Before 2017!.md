We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVkX112lYCY&t=0) |  (swish noise) - All right, Insiders, you

know the deal. This is Creator Insider. This is your weekly Newsflash. And we're going to give you all of those useful snippets about what's going on at YouTube that could impact you. Let's get into it. First off, let's start with timed comments in beta. Now in April, we rolled out an experiment that allowed users to view comments timed to the exact moment you're watching in a video. The goal was to provide more context to comments, but also, to show where the best conversation was happening

news is we're expanding this beta to make it widely available to users on iOS and users on Android. Now, let's move on to achievement, your achievements. This is about an experiment we're running within studio dashboard, where we show creators achievement cards. Creators will see these cards when they're passing certain milestones, for example, around subscribers, views, and watched time hours. The goal of this is to better recognize creators and their amazing work.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVkX112lYCY&t=60) |  Next up, let's discuss unlisted videos uploaded

before January 1st, 2017 and how a security update is going to impact them. Now, as most of you know, there are three visibility settings you can apply to any YouTube video: public, private, and unlisted. Unlisted meaning that anybody who you've shared the link with can view it. Now, as of July 23rd, any videos that have been uploaded as unlisted before January 1st, 2017 will be switched to private

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVkX112lYCY&t=90) |  as part of a security update. Now,

let's talk impact. Only unlisted videos uploaded before January 1st, 2017 are impacted by this change. If you want your videos to remain unlisted, you can opt out of the change. You can also continue to change the privacy settings on these videos at any time. To learn more about the change, why it's happening, and how you can opt out consult the help center link we've left in the description of this video to learn more.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVkX112lYCY&t=120) |  Now, most of you have already done

this, but if you haven't, please provide your tax form as soon as possible. It only takes 15 minutes in AdSense and a tax form will help determine the applicable tax rate on your US earnings. Otherwise, Google is required to withhold the default tax rate of 24% on your earnings. If you want to learn more about this, and what you're required to do via AdSense, you can consult the forum link in the description for this video. And that's about it from this week's Newsflash.

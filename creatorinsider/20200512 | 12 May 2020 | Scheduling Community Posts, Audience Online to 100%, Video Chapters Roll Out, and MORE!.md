Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=0) |  - Hello, Insiders, newsflash time. First item,

the option to use the classic upload flow will start to be removed very gradually. I think we're staring with about 1%. As you may recall, the new upload flow, the number one complaint about it was that it was not possible to do bulk uploads. And now that has been added. We've been getting great feedback, so we're getting ready to retire the classic uploads flow.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=30) |  So, if you have any feedback on

that new uploads flow, let us know in the comments below. But so far, we've been hearing pretty good feedback, and we're pretty excited about its improved reliability over the classic uploads flow. Next, a longstanding feature request that we've been hearing for years is to make it easier to know when your channel's audience is online at YouTube. Obviously, if you're trying to schedule a premiere  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=60) |  or a livestream, knowing if there's a

certain day of the week or time of day when they're not online to avoid those kind of cold spots could be useful. Actually, we did a sneak peek about that feature a few weeks ago. And we started rolling it out very gradually, but now it's available to all 100% of creators. So, check it out. Super cool feature. Might help you as you plan when to make your content especially if it's live content available to your audience.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=90) |  As a reminder, if you're scheduling a

regular video upload like a video on-demand, that one you may not need to worry as much about publish time since the longterm performance has not been proven to be related to what day or time of week a video is uploaded. But certainly if you're doing a livestream or a premiere, something to keep in mind. Next, as a reminder, we're continuing to roll out the optional setting

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=120) |  that holds potentially inappropriate comments for review

as the default for channels to help creators manage their comments at scale and improve the quality of the conversations on your channel. We plan to finalize this rollout in the next few weeks. You'll see a message in YouTube Studio when the setting has been enabled for your channel. This setting is available to all channels already. You can turn it on or off at any time  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=150) |  with the instructions that are linked below.

When we first launched this feature, enabled channels experience a 75% drop in flagged comments. And over the past two years, we've had teams focus on expanding the feature to cover 13 languages as well as improved accuracy. Link below for more information about this important hold-potentially-inappropriate-comments feature.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=180) |  Next, YouTube has removed live DVR capabilities

from HTML 5 in iOS, mainly mobile web. This means that a user will no longer be able to seek backwards during a live event on those devices. You know, the goal is to deliver the best playback experience possible, and this functionality sees very low usage and adversely affects other core features  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=210) |  of a YouTube Live playback experience, so

we've chosen to retire it for the moment. Next, scheduling community posts is now available on the desktop web main app. This launch allows creators to draft community posts ahead of time and specify that future publishing date. It has been requested quite a bit, so thank you for all the feedback. We heard you, and the team has launched that feature. Next, you may recall back in early April,

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=240) |  we were part of an experiment around

video chapters. You may have even spotted them on Creator Insider Newsflashes, including this one. We've seen a lot of positive creator and viewer feedback, so we wanted to let you know how to opt in to this feature as everyone will be getting access in a few weeks. So, some details. All you have to do is ensure that if you have these timestamps in your description, make sure that the first timestamp listed  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=270) |  in the video description starts at 0:00

and that your video has at least three timestamps or chapters with each chapter being 10 seconds or longer. You can just look in the description below to see how we do it if that doesn't make any sense. Now, if for some reason you use timestamps in your description, but you don't like our chapter feature where we kind of make it easier for viewers to jump and visualize it, you can disable it. You can basically opt out. And all you need to do is adjust the first timestamp  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=300) |  in your video description to be something

other than 0:00. For example, you could just change it to 0:01, and that will indicate to us that, hey, this video doesn't want the chapter feature enabled. And you'll just kind of appear like you've done an old-school mode. If you have questions or feedback about that feature, please leave it in the comments below. We'll be sharing it with the team. And lastly, this week's newsflash trivia.  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=330) |  First, let's acknowledge last week's winner or

winners. The question, as a reminder, was if you wanted to get a sense of a channel's reach, the size of its total audience, what metrics would you look at? And the hint was that subscriber count, while it is very easy remember and very visible and something we all know and think about  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cyDnxaXspEY/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=360) |  is actually not the best measurement of

your channel's actual audience. For a variety of reasons, there are better metrics. And there were two potential answers. One was, okay, let's say you don't have access to that channel's YouTube analytics. You're just, like a main app, like just a viewer looking at someone else's channel. The first person to guess correctly  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=390) |  in that case was Awesome Wood Things,

and the answer was views. So if you look at a channel, and you look at their last few videos, and you look at typically how many views they get, that's generally a much better indicator of the reach and how many people are kind of actively watching this channel's content than the subscriber count. The next is, what if you do have access to internal metrics, you do have access to the YouTube analytics  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=420) |  for your channel. What number or metric

would you look at to get a sense of the reach of your channel? And the first person to guess that was Fully Involved Media Group, and the answer is unique viewers, which is a metric we launched a couple years ago. But many people may not know about it. So if you go to YouTube Studio, and you go to Analytics, and then you go to Audience,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyDnxaXspEY&t=450) |  you'll see a unique viewer's metric. And

if you just say like the last 28 days, that's pretty much the best indication of the general order of magnitude size of your audience, which in some cases is actually bigger than the sub count, some cases not. But that's really a very good way to think about the size of your audience. Okay, so congrats to both Awesome Wood Things and Fully Involved Media Group. With that, I'll just say goodbye and keep it real.

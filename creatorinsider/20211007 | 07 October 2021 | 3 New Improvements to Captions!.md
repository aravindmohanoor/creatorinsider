#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOllDRg0LV4&t=0) |  - Hi everyone, my name's Edward and

I work on captions at YouTube. Today, I want to give you a sneak peek on a couple of new launches designed to improve the accessibility experience on YouTube, specifically around captions and audio. First up is English live automatic captions. We plan to make English live automatic captions available for all creators. Up until now, live automatic captions was only available for select channels with over 1,000 subs, just for beta testing purposes. With this expansion, now all creators can have access to this feature. Creators can go into their live control room

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOllDRg0LV4&t=30) |  and enable or disable live automatic captions

per stream, allowing you to make your content even more accessible to your viewers. For now, we'll start with English, but we plan to add more languages in the future. The second update is that we plan to soon expand auto-translate subtitles to mobile. Today on desktop, users can auto-translate available caption tracks in their CC menu to another language. We plan to soon bring this feature to mobile allowing our viewers to access even more content in language that they understand. The third new caption feature that we're launching is searchable captions in transcripts.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOllDRg0LV4&t=60) |  Now the transcripts feature has been on

desktop for a long time now, but as part of this launch, we're further enhancing that experience by making it searchable. In searchable transcripts, users can view and search transcripts for information that's most relevant for them. This allows them to find the most interesting information without watching the entire video. We also plan to bring this to mobile as well. Finally, I wanted to give you a quick update that we are still hard at work launching our new channels permissions subtitle role. With this subtitles role, creators will be able to delegate the ability

videos to someone that they trust, allowing them to save even more time and also make their videos even more accessible. Thanks for listening to all the different accessibility features coming up. I know that was a lot. I'll leave a bunch of information down below and I would love to hear your feedback.

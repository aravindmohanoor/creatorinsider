When you go to the corporate type and in the futures you will see there an additional check box which is called prevent copies, which means if you check this box, we as YouTube will rechecked or will not allow anybody to upload the same video on the platform.

need to us. - Got it. So for this new feature, basically when I report the video using the current web form there's this new check box in there that says if anybody we uploads the copy of that video, that we're importing it will be automatically rejected upon upload. And then any similar copies will surface in the copy match tool for me to review. Is that correct? - Yes That's correct. So when you go to the corporate match tool, so you go

corporate tab, you will see like a list of tech that you have filed, and you will also see the numbers of videos we have or numbers of copies we have automatically prevented in case you've changed your mind. You can also disable this functionality by clicking here again. - So I'm sure some creators are wondering do the auto removals result in strikes for the uploader? - That's a very good question. No, they will not resolve neither

community guideline strike. - So this is a great update but I'm sure some creators probably have concerns about potential for abuse of this new feature. Can you talk a little bit more about that? - We take the abuse very seriously. So we will carefully review the requests and misuse of the tool can result in either taking the tool away or even in termination of your account. - Okay. That's really good to know. So when can creators expect to see these changes

start rolling it out today because we want to do it careful. We will doing it slowly over the next couple of months.

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=0) |  (door closes) - Hello? Oh, hey Tom.

Yeah, I'm just about to do it now. Any tips? Be casuable, be funny. No pressure. Don't wear a shirt. Okay, well, you know, that one I've cracked. Well, you've left some pretty big shoes to fill,  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=30) |  so I'm going to do my best

for you, Tom. (loud crashing) Whoo! What's up, insiders? My name is Connor, I work on the ads policy team. And what my team does is, we write the advertiser friendly guidelines. And how that impacts you? is those guidelines decide what gets a green icon and what guides a yellow icon.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=60) |  And we also work on clarifying the

questionnaire that's now accessible by everybody in YPP. And it's something that we're gonna be doing an awful lot of work on over the coming weeks. So I'm here to be one of your first of many new hosts of the newsflash going forward. And I'll hope to bring some of that policy knowledge in, but I have some really exciting non-policy news flashes for you today. The first is about the YT video overview experiment.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=90) |  Now this is a new analytics video

of a view that has smarter explanations about how your video is doing. It's gonna tell you more about how it's doing from the point of view of the YouTube homepage and watch next suggestions. It's also gonna call it two key metrics. Now, the first of those is the click through rate and your average view duration, which are important signals as we know of your art audiences, interest and engagement in what you're talking about.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=120) |  And now Patricia is gonna do this

justice by going through a deep dive sneak peek on this soon. So stay tuned for more information. Next up, we have the new made for kids video filtering feature in studio. So this is pretty simple. Creditors can now easily filter for videos marked as made for kids set by you or set to made for kids, which is set by us in YouTube. And that's gonna be found  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=150) |  on the videos page of studio. Next

up we have the new copyright strike popup. Now what that's gonna involve is the copyright strike pop up, rolling into YouTube studio. This was something that was available in classic, and it tells you when a new copyright strike appears on your channel. When you actually log into studio net. And now much like the old pop up, it's going to tell you some general information about copyright strikes, and they'll also be some links where you can review details around the strike,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=180) |  like who issued it and what videos

were taken down or how you can actually resolve it. So we hope that's going to be really helpful. And now next up I'm introducing Laurie. Who's filmed her own segment. She's trying to hijack my audition to be host here, but we'll forgive her that. And she's gonna talk a little bit about fameBit and an exciting update from her team. Hi everyone. My name is Laurie and I lead the global business for fameBit

YouTube branded content platform. As we discussed a few weeks ago, we will be expanding and evolving our full service offering to better serve creators brands and viewers. And we are also introducing some new changes to the platform that we believe will help us achieve this goal. Today, I'm going to share a few immediate changes and take a look at what's to come with YouTube branded content,  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=240) |  including more creator eligibility, something I know

you've all been asking for. First off, we'd like to reintroduce ourselves. FameBit is now officially YouTube brandConnect. in keeping with our core YouTube product identity. Now we've spoken to a lot of you and brands, and what we've realized is fameBit doesn't really signal branded content, nor does it align with YouTube. So after speaking with a lot of creators  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=270) |  and surveying a lot of advertisers as

well, we've decided that YouTube brandConnect is the way to go. We're doubling down on the features that make us unique with influencer marketing, such as audience-based matchmaking, true organic measurement tools and product innovations, like the shopping shelf, AR try-on and more. these tools allow your fans to shop, download apps and virtually try on products  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=300) |  directly from your videos, helping drive even

more fan engagement. You can read more on the YouTube blog, which will drop a link to below. We wanna make it as easy as possible for creators to be onboarded. Now eligible creators can find YouTube brandConnect directly within YouTube studio. Here, You can view the terms and sign up so we can start pitching you to brands for campaigns.

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=330) |  We've also focused on delivering new tools

and resources to help you succeed on YouTube. Many of you are aware of the incredible creator Academy resource. We've just launched a brand new course on how to make money with branded content, check out the course link below and let us know what you think. We're looking at building even more great features to help creators manage their campaigns this year and more products to drive engagement, like the media shelf for streaming shows and movies.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=360) |  Finally, as mentioned, we're working really hard

to bring YouTube branded content to more creators across the U.S and internationally. And we'll be sure to get back to you on updates there soon. Well, that's all I've got for you now. Thanks everyone. And we're really looking forward to seeing the incredible branded content that all of you will be creating on YouTube this year. - Whoo (Connor clapping) Thanks Larry.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=390) |  That's it for this week. But wait,

we haven't actually announced our most important topic, which is who won Tom's last trivia question, the question if you don't remember was approximately how many subscribers did this channel have in July of 2017? And the person, to guess the quickest. you've guessed it, was easy peasy for an answer, with 10,000 subscribers. We definitely grown since then,  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=420) |  and that's in no small part down

to this community, which gives us great feedback in the comments and really keeps us on track. Now I'm told I have to think of some trivia myself. So I'm gonna dig deep and go back to Ireland where I'm from, and ask you, what famous alcoholic beverage is called the wine of Ireland, comment below, and we'll pick out the person  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO3c6WT_4E&t=450) |  with their quickest finger on the pulse

next week. Thanks for having me. Bye bye.

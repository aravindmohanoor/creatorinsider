#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=0) |  what's up insiders I'm lauren I'm a

program manager on our creator team at youtube and today we're here with assaf who's gonna talk about what the studio team has been working on to make sure that creators can publish their videos in the best state possible so welcome to the show soft hello insiders today we're going to be talking about what the team is calling pre-published checks so what does that mean whenever a video is uploaded to youtube youtube  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=30) |  runs a bunch of checks on that

video to check that there are no copyright claims on it to make sure that the video is meeting our community guidelines and if the creator is monetizing to make sure that the video is suitable to run ads and this project is about taking everything that's happening behind the scenes and bringing it front and centers as part of the apple flow to help creators kind of like understand what the state of their video is and also have them make sure that they don't publish with any issues on their video  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=60) |  that's awesome so lots of transparency I

can imagine that creators would really like knowing all of this up front I'm trying to imagine what it would look like in studio can you walk me through what the flow would look like yeah so I actually have a demo let me show you let's say I wanna upload a video to youtube using studio i'll demo the the new checkstep so this is my test channel I use it for

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=90) |  to test a bunch of new features

I preferred a test video with with copyrighted music on it just for the sake of this demo so i'll select this file and let's see what happens the upload experience opens as usual i'll set this video as not made for kids I type in my title and description i'll  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=120) |  set my monetization on for this video

and mark the add suitability and that is the new step that starts that's called the check step and that's where we show you how the video is being checked checked in this case for copyright issues so it should take up to four minutes it  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=150) |  actually it usually takes even less than

that and you can see the progress down down here at the bottom as well the checks would start once the video is done processing so in this case the video is done processing and as you can see youtube found the claim on that video and so therefore the video is inevitable for monetization and I can choose to see details here

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=180) |  monetization inevitable and I can decide whether

I want to replace the song use the song to speak the claim or take any other action if I want to ignore this warning and try to set this video to public i'll be warned again that the monetization is this video is not eligible for monetization because of the issue  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=210) |  and I can choose to publish anyway

or review the issue and act on it so yeah that's it that's the new kind of like check step that's a new thing we're adding that's the place where we're going to indicate the creators whether their video is in a good state and whether they can go ahead and publish without any issues okay so in the demo you just showed we saw what the copyright flow would look like you mentioned earlier monetization and policy will probably be included in this  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=240) |  in the future can you tell me

a little bit more about what that would look like right so the demo I just shared is what we're building right now it's still kind of like working progress so what I just showed you includes just the copyright claims at the moment but we are planning to release this with also the monetization eligibility checks and this is how it would look like we have a screenshot of what we're working on one of the best practices we always tell creators is to

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=270) |  upload their videos to unlisted a few

hours before they publish to make sure there are no monetization issues with this check implemented will they still have to do that or will it be taken care of that should take care of it however if creators wanna don't wanna wait on the check step until all checks are done if they wanna kind of like rush through it they should then save the video as unlisted or or private and they can come back to that get back to that video at any point in  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=300) |  the future and check the restrictions in

the video list to see if there are any restrictions on that video and address those before they go before they publish okay so there are a couple different ways creators can make sure that their videos are in a good state before they publish so once you have copyright and monetization taken care of are there other features you'd like to add to this yeah absolutely we really want to keep on working on this to make sure that everything is reflected and players get the best possible indication of the state of their video  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8&t=330) |  we started with copyright and monetization because

those are the two most common restrictions but we are planning absolutely to add additional restrictions in the future and help creators avoid any issues when they publish their videos so yeah stay tuned if creators are excited about this can they expect to see it in studio anytime soon yeah so we're it's it's in the works we're working on it hopefully it will start rolling out in the coming weeks if you guys have any thoughts

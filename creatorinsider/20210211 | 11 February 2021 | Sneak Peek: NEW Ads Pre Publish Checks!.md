## Sneak Peek: NEW Ads Pre Publish Checks!

Hello Insiders! Today we're back to talk about improvements to the pre publish¬†check feature Assaf talked about last year. We're excited to add monetization¬†checks to the upload flow in the next month or so. The plan is to begin rolling this out gradually at the end of February, but we'd love your feedback in the meantime.



Here's Assaf's video on copyright checks in case you missed it:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vThR6sQSB8

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg&t=0) |  - Hello insiders, my name is Anne

and I'm a product manager working on YouTube studio. As I have already gave a sneak peek into copyright pre published X last year and our team has some exciting updates. Just to recap our goal is still to help you publish more videos in a good state, which means making you aware of any restrictions on monetization or viewership before you publish a video. So, what does that mean? Essentially when you upload a video to YouTube relearn checks in the background

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg&t=30) |  to determine whether that copyright claims on

your video and whether it's suitable for it and a couple of hours. And what we want to do is make it easier for you to access these check results before you publish a video and give you the control to act on the restrictions before you publish. One more thing to note the checks do not guarantee that there won't be any other issues after you've published a video for instance, if you've changed metadata like the total to include profanity that might change writings later on  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg&t=60) |  and we are also not checking yet

for every possible background check, for now we make available for you at suitability and corporate checks which have been the most requested by creatives. So, we uploaded a video and on the next page the enter title and description, then we turn on monetization. At suitability checks will only be available to monetize and creators, corporate checks will be available for all creators independent of whether you're monetizing or not.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg&t=90) |  Now, on the Ad suitability page we

still ask you to rate your video. We believe that no one knows your video better than you and you help us make our systems even better. For creators with high self-certification accuracy we will still take your writing into account. Now, on the check step, we will display you the result of the checks. On the top VC corporate checks, these are the texts that the staff talked about and now we have the new check app suitability, as I said these will be available

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg&t=120) |  for monetizing channels that are owned by

BP and for videos that are monetized. In case there are any restrictions find for copyright or at suitability, we offer you full control to act on any restrictions for instance, dispute a copyright claim or request to review for it suitability. In the past we used to recommend that you put a video into understood for a couple of hours to make sure that your video is at suitable. With this launch this is no longer necessary since we display the results of the checks during upload. You don't have to wait until checks finish  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg&t=150) |  you can of course close to a

window and come back later to review the status, dress any issues and publish. We will hopefully be able to bring a suitability as well as corporate checks to you within the next couple of weeks. And we're already thinking about how to improve checks beyond that initial launch for instance, we are thinking about notifying you on the gate once checks are complete so, you don't have to wait. A second idea we have is bringing checks to mobile and the first idea is to extend checks  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg&t=180) |  beyond the initial two types of checks

so, I'd be really happy to make what you think is most important to take a first and whether you have any feedback, comments, or questions if so, please leave them in the comment section below we will make sure to read every last comment.

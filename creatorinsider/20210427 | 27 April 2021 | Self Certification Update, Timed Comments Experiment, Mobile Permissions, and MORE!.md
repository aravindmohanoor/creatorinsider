Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tg-YJ6s8pI&t=0) |  - What's up insiders. Welcome to this

week's news flash. All the updates you need directly from the tech team. Let's get into it. Let's talk mobile permissions. Now, currently users that have access to manage a channel via channel permissions can only do so via studio desktop. But the great news that we're sharing with you on this week's newsflash is that pretty soon, over the coming weeks, we'll be rolling out that access on studio mobile as well. Why is this a good thing? Well, delegate users can use this access to

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tg-YJ6s8pI&t=30) |  view the mobile dashboard, view artists analytics,

as well as edit video, metadata, and settings. Good to know that this is being rolled out on Android first with iOS to follow. Let's talk experiments. We're experimenting with a link from the YouTube main app to the studio app. This link is going to be found on the your videos list under library. What we're trying to do is make it easier for you to switch between the two apps. For example, in the case of upload journeys. This next update is really exciting.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tg-YJ6s8pI&t=60) |  What we're doing is testing a feature

that will allow you to view comments timed to a specific moment you're watching within a video. This is going to help provide more context but also show you where the best conversation is happening in a video. Now, a couple of things to keep in mind, number one, it's being experimented with a small group of users on a small group of videos. If you want to figure out whether you're in the experiment group, click on top comments on iOS or Android

could be expanded to the entire user base of YouTube, but it's only if we get good and positive feedback. So make sure to provide that to us if you're in the experiment group. Now let's turn to self-certification. Self-certification previously defaulted to the algorithmic monetization reading if a creator self-certified one of their videos incorrectly. Now, what's changing is we're allowing creators  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tg-YJ6s8pI&t=120) |  to make two incorrect ratings on two

separate videos per 90 days before defaulting back to that algorithmic monetization writing. Quick note, the system will only penalize creators who incorrectly self-certify an upload as green when it's in fact yellow, not the other way around. All right, creators, that's it from this week's news flash. From the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators. Thanks so much for tuning in and make sure to like and subscribe.

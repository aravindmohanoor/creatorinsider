## Introducing YOUTUBE CONTRIBUTORS. Who they are and how they can help YOU!

Hello Insiders! Today we have a special video for you introducing you to a community that you may or may not already know of, the YouTube Contributors.¬†



These are folks who have direct relationships with YouTube and advanced insights on many topics‚Äîfrom how to use new features, to how to grow a channel. 



You can find them sharing insights in discussion forums (https://support.google.com/youtube/community?hl=en), including the official¬†YouTube Help Communities, creating their own¬†educational videos (playlist linked below), and answering questions in help video comments.



There are many Contributors, in many countries, but we want to introduce a few of them to you today.



As you know, we read all the feedback from our CI Nation, but we don't have time to individually¬†answer most questions. That's where you can keep an eye our for YT Contributors. 



While they frequently post to our official forums, they've been known to jump in our videos to help as well, and we hope to see more of them in the future! Show them some love in the comments if you'd like that!



In addition, they each have areas of expertise so feel free to use them as resources if you're interested or need help better understanding a particular topic they cover. Check out their channels and profiles below!



Lastly, as mentioned in the video, if you're interested in applying to the program, check out the link below. If accepted, you'll get access to perks which you can find here:¬†https://contributors.youtube.com/.

I am the founder of the channel called Video Creators. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio.

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdQNsNJoSPg&t=210) |  Our expertise, today, really focuses on that

person who is currently making videos and trying to grow but not seeing the amount of traction that they would like. If that's something you would like to learn more about, check out our channel at YouTube.com/videocreators. We're looking forward to meeting you. (speaking German)

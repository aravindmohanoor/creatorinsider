#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=0) |  - I don't know if this is

gonna be great - Whenever its my laptop too. - It could be me, you know, you're kind of pixelated. It's not the end of the world, you know, if it's pixelated we have Lo-Fi on our channel so, if you don't mind it. - If its pixilated that would suck. - I don't know maybe you look better. Like who knows maybe it's actually an improvement, you know. (Neal laughs) Hello Insiders. Today we have a very exciting, I hope video. Tom started a series called, "Interviewing My Boss." And I was the first boss that he interviewed  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=30) |  and we thought that went well. So

now we're gonna take it up a level and I'm gonna try to interview my boss. And I'm Ariel, as you may recall and I'm responsible for Creator Products, which is a part of YouTube. And I have the pleasure of talking to my boss, Neal Mohan, who's the Chief Product Officer at YouTube. So he's responsible for all products at YouTube. So, Hey, Neal, how are you? - Hey Ariel nice to be with you. Glad to join you in front of the camera. - Yeah. And we'll see how pixelated you are, maybe, you know, we have low standards on this channel  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=60) |  but we will see how this plays

out. Thank you for humoring us. So let's start, just tell us a little bit about you. Where are you from, et cetera? - I grew up mostly in the Midwest in Michigan of all places. Let's see. I lived kinda all over the place. Michigan, Florida, I actually spent a few years in India during high school, believe it or not. And then I came back to the States to California for college. And I've been at Google as you know, actually almost as long as you and not quite as long as you, but.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=90) |  - I've been 15 and a half

years. How many, how long have you been here? - I'm not even close then. (Ariel laughs) I've been here for over 12 years. I came to Google when we sold a company called DoubleClick to Google and for a long time, in fact, most of my time at Google, I was the SVP of Google's display and video Ads products. And I came over to YouTube five years ago as the Head of Products. It has been awesome working with all of our amazing creators. - How do you compare YouTube to Ads? - So, you know, just as well as I do  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=120) |  that there's a big ads part of

YouTube, obviously that you and I both work on on a regular basis. In fact, the primary way that all of our creators generate revenue is through advertising. And so Ads is a really big part of YouTube. And in fact, the way that I was exposed to YouTube and the way that I worked with YouTube even before coming over as in my current role was through advertising and monetization. What I'd say is a little bit different, is getting to work much more closely with all of the amazing creative talent that's out there.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=150) |  And, you know, you obviously experience that

every day I get to as well. And so that's been a really positive aspect of being here at YouTube. And then the other one of course, is that first in, just as much as YouTube is a product for our creators, it's also a product for our users. And so just, a big part of my job as Chief Product Officer is building features and functionality that our users will love and will make it so that they can connect with all of our creators  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=180) |  much more seamlessly, much more effectively as

well. - Yeah, Which leads me to another question. So now that you've been here five years, like how would you compare the YouTube that you found to the YouTube that you have now? What are the kind of the big differences that you've seen? - Yeah. You know, that's a good question. And I would say that in some sense, lots of things are really still the same, not just in my five years, but frankly I think from everything that I've seen over the entire kind of history of YouTube, which is it's a platform fundamentally about connecting  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=210) |  our awesome creators with their audiences as

in fans around the world. That original mission of YouTube in terms of giving everyone a voice has remained the same and consistent. So I think that that's been a really interesting to observe. But lots of aspects have changed. One is, you know, YouTube has continued to grow a platform that we take in some sense, sort of for granted today has grown dramatically in the five years that I've been here in terms of the presence of the platform all over the world,  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=240) |  ways for creators to connect with fans,

not just where they're located but really all over the world. That aspect of community has continued to grow as we continue to build more products for users to connect with their fans. And then the creativity of our creators, you know, whether it's sort of the traditional sort of VOD videos that we have on our platform, whether it's things like stories, whether it's the growth of things like live, all of that are really interesting ways for our creators to continue to be more and more creative.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=270) |  So that's been super interesting to see

over the last five years. - So one of the things that I've seen and we've worked together a lot on it is just kind of, I think what you call the responsibility, kind of, for example, in my world, how the monetization program has changed, YPP or a partner program. Can you touch a little bit on kinda your view on YouTube's role from a perspective of responsibility. - Yeah. I mean, I think that the way that I would think about that is, you know, kinda back to what I just said, which is, YouTube is a global platform, it's available to users and to creators all over the world  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=300) |  and that's part of the magic of

the platform. You know, you can put your creative idea on the platform and build an audience, including fans that might be on the other side of the world. And 2 billion users come to the platform every single month. And so when you say responsibility, what I, the way I think about it is, we do have a responsibility as a global platform. We're not just a reflection of what's happening in the world today. We have an impact on the world, all of which creators  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=330) |  have profound impact on their audiences, on

what's happening in the world. And so one of the parts of my job, I know you view this as a big part of your job, is to make sure that YouTube remains an open platform but one that is also safe for all of our users, the entire ecosystem, our creators, our users, our advertiser partners, et cetera. And that's reflected in our community guidelines. - Yeah, and we've been spending a lot of time on it like you're saying, together and it's been a really interesting journey and comparing where we were five years ago  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0HRO0w9m7vA/maxres1.jpg)



#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=360) |  to where we are today I think

there were like dramatic differences I think creators can see as well. - Yeah. And I mean, I think it's been, you know, I think you and I would be, I think the first people to say that it's been a journey, a learning journey, certainly for me, hopefully all of our creators recognize this. But there's thousands of employees at YouTube who are really dedicated to this mission of living up as a responsible global platform to protect our users, protect our creators. The vast, vast majority of whom are, are out there looking to create amazing content,  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=390) |  produce great sort of positive energy sort

of for the world and that's the responsibility that we try to live up to every day is to make sure that they can continue to do that in a safe environment. - Okay. Hey Neal, thanks for coming back. Just for the viewers, we had some wifi issues and the sun was getting in the way of the camera and the quality was even below the Creator Insider standard, which is pretty low. So thank you for moving to a new location. So let's go to the next question. So we're in the middle of a really bad pandemic  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=420) |  around the world where COVID or Coronavirus

and that's impacted both creators and employees of YouTube. And I'm curious, kind of over the last couple of months, what have you seen and what do you think creators should be thinking about? - So first of all obviously is as you know, Ariel, this is impacting not just us here at YouTube, but literally all of humanity all around the world in this way, obviously for several months and it looks like it will continue for some time. And it's had a profound impact on our entire ecosystem,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=450) |  all of our users and creators and

advertisers, of course, but everybody here working at YouTube every day. And in fact when it was becoming clear that this was gonna become a truly global crisis and you know, early on this year in the February, March timeframe, our first responsibility was to really ensure the safety of all of our employees, our extended workforce. And so many of you may have seen the impacts of that when our extended workforce had to go offline,  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=480) |  some of them work from home, many

of them are offline. And that resulted in us moving to much more automated systems to enforce our community guidelines, et cetera, of course. So people, including many creators saw the impact of that. That's been a ongoing, hopefully that's gone relatively smoothly, although there's been, uptakes and things like false positives, et cetera. But that was one of the immediate impacts of COVID on all of us as employees. I would say the other thing from a user standpoint is that users are thirsty for information  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=510) |  around COVID, around Coronavirus to protect their

families, their communities. News consumption on our platform is up 75% year on year as people are looking for this information. You've probably seen lots of things that we're doing in the product, from everything from the COVID news shelf that runs as soon as you open up the YouTube app to information panels that run below videos linking out to local or regional health to provide the most relevant useful information to our users.  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=540) |  And then even when users are searching

for that type of information on YouTube, an information panel provides again, that latest information. Because one of the unique aspects of this crisis is that, science and knowledge is being created on an hourly or daily basis. And so we wanna make sure that our users are getting the most authoritative and relevant information when they're looking for it on YouTube. So that's what I would say is a second a really big impact. And then the third of course is it's been amazing to see  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=570) |  our creators really step up in many

ways. First on, you know, early on in the pandemic, it was around encouraging people to shelter in place if they could, to flatten the curve. Live streams, where people from all over the world who are dealing with this stress in their own families could come together and consume content all at once. And so we've seen lots of growth in creative uses of live streams, our creator stepping forward to generate donations  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=600) |  for worthy causes around COVID et cetera.

So that's been the third really big impact, and it's been really gratifying to see the amazing work that all of our creators around the world have been doing to help kind of all of humanity deal with this crisis. - Yeah. Another aspect that might be interesting is that I've heard from creators in the early days when we were demonetizing videos related to COVID cause we thought of it as a potentially short event, what we call sensitive events ad we just took a position of, you know, let's not monetize these,  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=630) |  but once we realized that it's going

to be a longer event and with the help of many creators who give us strong feedback, that they have a role to play in getting that information out, we really modified the policies as well, so that we could monetize. So all these activities that you're talking about had to be, we have to change the way we enforce our policies to allow monetization. So let's get into some rapid fire questions. Tom, when he introduced the idea that maybe we'll interview you, asked the audience for questions and we've been hearing a bunch of topics  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=660) |  as well with creators ongoing. So let's

start hitting you, you know, Tom likes to say, let's keep it real. So let's hit you with some rapid fire questions. - All right - And thoughts. So the first one is which is kind of like why we're here, but maybe I don't want to lead the witness. When I joined YouTube, there was a lot of unhappiness from creators about transparency and communication. I'd like to think that we've improved, but you know, who knows, we'll hear from our audience. But how do you think about communicating with creators? - Yeah, I mean, so, you know, hopefully this,  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=690) |  what we're doing right now is one

example of that, Creator Insider. I can't remember exactly when it was launched or when you know, you were sort of - Yeah. I launched it. I can't remember exactly, I'm guessing at least two years or something right. Yeah. - If somebody should remember, it should be you. It's been years and it's grown nicely. And I think that part of the reason is because I do think creators appreciate its attempt at transparency. And so that's certainly one channel. And so feedback around how we can continue to make that better and more useful for our creators  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=720) |  is obviously one aspect. I would say

that the primary, at least from my standpoint, and I'm biased obviously is as the product guy is really is studio. And so obviously, Ariel your team has done a phenomenal job in terms of the new studio. But sort of creating that as a place, almost as a news hub, if you will, for the latest and greatest around what impacts our creators on a regular basis. I think is a vision that we all had early on when we were reenvisioning studio. And I think you're starting to see that play out,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0HRO0w9m7vA/maxres2.jpg)



#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=750) |  but there's obviously a lot more that

can be done there in terms of news flashes, you know, kind of the need to know information that we're providing to users there. And so that's what I would say, also we've picked up the pace on social. So everything from, Team YouTube, all of our other social handles as well. I think our response rates have been improved by something like 50%. We're doing 150% of volume. And so that's another channel that I would encourage all of our creators to make sure that they're plugged into.  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=780) |  Those are you know, some examples of

things that we have established and wanna continue to grow but there's obviously lots more work to be done there. And also, like I said, at the beginning, if there's feedback on things that we can do to improve that, please, please let us know about that. - Add in the comments below the video and it will be reading it. And speaking of policies like how do you think about policies in general at YouTube? What's changed over the years that you've been here? I know that my perspective as a policy  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=810) |  is really drive our decisions and we

don't do one off decisions. Which sometimes can be frustrating for a creator because they don't always understand the context for why the policy is there. But my understanding of the policies is we really use them to balance all the different constituents and come up with a principled approach to how we make decisions. But I'm curious how you see policies and the role that YouTube and how should creators think about policies. - Yeah. I mean, I think the first principle and I'll just be very, very upfront about this is we think about our policies from the standpoint  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=840) |  that the vast, vast majority of our

creators are really trying to do the right thing to grow their audiences, to grow their business. And our job at YouTube is to really support that fundamental mission. And when we think about our policies, we really do try to look through that lens. How do we stop the very small fraction of bad actors so that the vast majority of creators can continue to do what they do and create the magic of YouTube. And that I think is a really important point. Sometimes I think that, that gets lost  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=870) |  in the day to day sort of

communications around that when we get into the nitty gritty, but taking a step back that really is the big picture. The second aspect of course is, and you alluded to this is really trying to strike that healthy balance in the ecosystem. We write our policies in a way that they can apply equally to everyone on the platform. I think that, that's the most fair and just way of doing it. I think one area that, I know I've gotten feedback on and I know that Ariel, you have to,  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=900) |  where I think we can continue to

do better is be clear about those policies as possible. Be transparent about them. Because as I said, I think the vast majority of our creators are looking to do the right thing. And I think it's YouTube's responsibility to be as crystal clear about what those policies are so that our creators can continue to do the right thing and produce awesome content. - Okay. So the next topic that comes up a lot with creators and I'm sure you've heard this in the past is, Trending. What is up with Trending? There's always a creator who is unhappy  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=930) |  about some other creator that they see.

It might be that they see videos from a media company or from music versus a YouTube first creator or there's all kinds of dynamics around Trending. How do you think about Trending? What's the goal of Trending and what are we doing if anything, to address the feedback from creators? - Yeah. Trending is a really interesting feature. And I think the questions that come up about, around Trending, perhaps the best way to really answer them is to actually go back to the basis of Trending in the first place.  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=960) |  Like why did we actually build this

feature? And one of the ideas was to create someplace where you could go, that could work in compliment to what users were already seeing in their home feed. And that destination would be something that would be not personalized in the same way that the home feed is but something that had sort of broader appeal, more general appeal in terms of the type of content that was, videos that were shown there and featured there. And so Trending was designed with that in mind. A place where users could go, new users to YouTube,  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=990) |  users that were familiar with YouTube, to

see videos that have sort of generally broad appeal. And so that's kind of where it started from. And of course the feedback that you are referring to, something, you know, you've heard, I've heard a lot and we wanna strike the right balance in terms of the broad appeal, as well as a destination that creators can feel is their own and really represent sort of the vibrancy of YouTube. And so we've made a number of changes to the product based on feedback that we've gotten from creators.  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1020) |  And one of the ones that I'm

excited about is where at least 50% of what we show there are gonna be videos that come from YouTube creators. And so I think that that is a win, not just for our YouTube creators, because they will be shown prominently in trending. But also a win for YouTube because it really depicts what YouTube is all about to our users, especially users that may not be as familiar with YouTube as you know, our daily users are.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1050) |  And so that's been a recent change

in place. Of course, if you have feedback on that, please provide it in the comments. - Okay. So let's end with a few questions from the comments when Tom asks for a specific question. So let's see, we have a channel called Lola land. And the question is, "Is it true that brand new channels "can't get recommended? "How much data in terms of views subs does YouTube need "from a brand new channel to start recommending it?"  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1080) |  And maybe I could also throw in

another version of this question, which is like, what would you recommend for new channels? - Yeah. I mean, and you should obviously chime in here as well cause you've obviously thought a lot about this. But I would say that, you know, I can give a very long answer on this, but the short answer is no. You know, there's, we don't, there's no sort of inherent disadvantage to a new channel there. Fundamentally it's really about the audience and the performance of the videos vis-a-vis that audience.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0HRO0w9m7vA/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1110) |  Every single day we take in on

the order of, you know, something like 80 billion signals from views and various forms of engagement and feedback, et cetera, to really determine what is best for that user right then and there in terms of their home feed or after they're done watching a video. And we've also done a lot of work to continue to make it so that new videos, new channels are not at a disadvantage. You know, fresh signals are incorporated  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1140) |  on a regular sort of realtime basis

there. And so that's work that we have that we have ongoing. And my overall sort of piece of advice in general is really just focusing on the content of the video, making it something that is true to your passion, authentically something that comes from you, something that you think will be engaging to the audience that you're looking to reach. And as long as you continue to focus on that, I think all of these other things are really extraneous. That is sort of the most important thing.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1170) |  - Yeah, I would say that really,

it's our job. And the algorithm's job is to find that talent, right. So I, you know, and we see creators who rise through kind of the size levels and are wildly successful and they started a short time ago, a long time ago, et cetera. So I absolutely encourage new creators to really focus on their content. And also with new ones is try to find something you're passionate about, but also where there's space and there's not 500 other creators doing exactly the same thing. It's kind of like starting a business to some degree, right. You really find your niche.  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1200) |  Okay. So let's see. I think we

have time for one more question, maybe. How about we go to this question from The Big Jackpot, "Does going live more often help or hurt my channel?" - Yeah. So this is something that we're continuing to look into. I think the short answer there from everything that we know, that I know is that it doesn't. We treat live content, video on demand content the same  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1230) |  from a recommendations, from our algorithm standpoint.

And, you know, what I would encourage there is, you know, similar to what I just said, which is, if you enjoy producing live content, if you think that's a great way to kind of get your message out, your creativity, connecting with your audience, then I would encourage you to continue to do that. You know, one of the things that we've seen as I was mentioning earlier as a result of the COVID pandemic and, you know,  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1260) |  many people around the world, sheltering at

home is the growth of live content. And we've seen that on our platform. And so if that's something that you enjoy doing and think is a great way to augment what you're already doing, then I would encourage you to continue to do that. - Hey, Neal, one last thing I forgot to ask you about and thank you for making more time. Glad I caught you. Is just what are you really excited about for the future? If you're a creator, what do you wanna hear from our Chief Product Officer and kind of get excited about the future of YouTube?  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1290) |  - Yeah Ariel, I think it really

comes down to a lot of the work that your team is leading here. Really two fundamental things on behalf of all of our creators. The first is continuing to build the tools and technology that our creators use every single day to connect with their audiences. The magic of YouTube, as you and I have talked about a lot, is the connection between our amazing creators and all their fans all over the world. So building out capabilities like YouTube posts and stories,  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1320) |  and other ways for creators and fans

to continue to connect, you may have all noticed the work that's gone on in terms of making comments below videos a much more vibrant and relevant and safe community for all of our users and creators. So work like that, I think is really important and is gonna be a top priority for us in the months and years ahead. And then the second big bucket of course is once that community is established and a strong connection

are the ways that we can help creators earn a living to produce all that amazing content on a regular basis. So all of our work around things like channel memberships, our work around super chat and super stickers, ways for creators to earn revenue above and beyond what we of course are continuing to do on the advertising side are also gonna remain important priorities,  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1380) |  so that creators can continue to grow

their presence on the platform and establish themselves as we often talk about creators are the new media economy. And so what are the things that we can do to support them as companies in this media economy are really big top priorities for us. And where a lot of our resources will continue to be focused in the years ahead. - Yeah. We've talked a lot about that and I know you've challenged us to deliver on it. That's like thinking about creators  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1410) |  who are creating businesses and have multiple

employees. And how do we think about that and how do we think for example about different users and we've been spending a lot of time on permission and you can have a creator who doesn't see, sorry, somebody who can log into studio who cannot see the revenue for example, but can manage the videos, cannot delete the channel. Like that's one example I think that addresses what you're talking about from the media company perspective. What kind of reporting can we do across channels? We see more and more creators creating multiple channels within their kind of new media companies.  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1440) |  So we're doing work on that front.

How do we become more and more precise in the way we ingest videos and understand the videos so that creators are not surprised in a negative way, right. As it become more and more a business basically and hiring staff, et cetera. So I agree with you. This is like a really interesting area for us at YouTube and we're spending a lot of time on it. We'll see if we can keep you and the creators happy on that front. - Yeah, I know it's great. I think better insights, more relevant insights and really making them actionable is really key  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1470) |  in that regard. - Neal, thanks a

lot for your time. We'll see if the audience likes it, even with this low fidelity shooting style that we have on Creator Insider. And I hope that if there's a lot of questions and follow up maybe we'll convince you to come back again. - Thanks for having me, I love being here. Hopefully it's not too pixelated, so let's see how it turns out. - Let's see what people say. And our audience is certainly vocal. So we'll hear back from them. And we have a tradition here where we always quote Tom,  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRO0w9m7vA&t=1500) |  Neal, keep it real. - I will

try my best. - Thank you. - Alright. Take care.

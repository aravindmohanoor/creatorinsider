Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=0) |  hello insiders we have a special guest

today I'm with Luke from the YouTube analytics engineering team welcome to the show loop thank you Tom all right now you have been working on YouTube analytics for how long now analytics since 2018 so about two years now oh right on what were some of the things that you worked on that creators may have used in the past I've been working  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=30) |  on a lot of audience focused data

sets yeah so this whole like knowing your audience better is something that YouTube analytics always had like the basic demographics like you know male female age geography but I think what you're working on and the area that you're looking at is to really increase the level of insight and understanding of the audience far beyond the the basic demographics right like it's interesting  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=60) |  to know that demographics and the age

range of your audience but oftentimes that's not directly actionable so I'm looking to find ways to give creators the ability to diagnose and act on growing their channel so knowing who's watching their videos and how they might appeal to them and you have been working on a specific concept that's now in kind of early stages of product development

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=90) |  yes I've been working on helping creators

know when their audiences online so specifically what hours within the week and so I can go ahead and present when your viewers are in YouTube this is for this lovely crater insider channel and we see the darker boxes here or it's more heavily populated and it gets lighter when it's not my turn Center has a fairly global audience overall as we can see at the bottom here with the United States and India being  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=120) |  the top countries but neither being a

dominant factor so it doesn't actually go down the ton throughout the week for the most part the audience is consistently most on YouTube in Europe time between 4 p.m. and seven or eight pm and just to be clear this is not necessarily when people are watching your channel this is when they're watching videos on YouTube so what do you think people should do with this like what should creator insider schedule its uploads closer to  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=150) |  the dark purple or how do we

interpret this so we're a little reluctant to say whether or not scheduling your uploads or more specifically the published times at the darker area really impacts long-term performance we don't quite have the data confidence to say that however this can help you engage with your community so you can schedule a post at this time you can try to engage with comments or by the community in

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=180) |  other ways you can do live streams

at these times that's where it's really effective there's live streams and maybe something like stories for a lightweight format it's possible that you could upload a creator insider video at 6:00 in the morning on Tuesday Europe time and that video over the long run may get just as many views maybe more than if you uploaded it and scheduled it to go live at Tuesday at 6 p.m. Europe time  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=210) |  because number one the platform job is

to try and match audience with content and so just because the video is a few hours old doesn't mean we stop trying and I guess number two there's also other people uploading and if everybody uploaded at 6 p.m. your of time maybe that wouldn't be optimal right so the thing is we don't really know it's very hard to get conclusive data on that  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=240) |  mm-hmm so we but we do know

it's useful for other friends we know it's useful for live stringent yes so while we're not confident that it should really be tailoring your upload schedule to this or your publish schedule to this using it in other ways can help you build that rhythm with your audience I love it yeah and I guess the other thing is if you are promoting your content on other platforms that are more timely let's say you know Twitter is an obvious

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=270) |  example where it's it might be more

important to to kind of converge your efforts around the time when your audience is consuming content so that's another thing to keep in mind it's a it's a hard problem that to solve but I'm I think what we've never shown this level of data and so I think it does peel at least one layer of the onion and now as you were building this we're there things Luke where you were wondering like oh I wonder if the  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=300) |  customer will prefer it this way or

that way anything that you want to share and get creator feedback on while we're we're connected since this is very useful for things like live streams and premieres one of the things that we've considered is if we should be splitting this down by winner your viewers watching live streams because maybe when they're on the bus or the train to work and they're not necessarily watching a  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=330) |  live stream though you know putting on

music or putting on some light content that they're kind of in and out of mmm so there are different types of viewer engagements and maybe your channels targeting one of them yeah you could take that even further and say what about when your viewers are watching videos from channels that are similar to yours yeah so one of the reasons we're not putting down just when years are watching your channel is it so heavily biased right on publish schedule yes it  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zerg1rH1Iu4&t=360) |  basically becomes a heat map of when

do you publish them right right and that's not terribly actionable but it could be interesting to say when our viewers likely to watch your content very cool Luke well thank you for sharing man if you like this report if you want to see it soon let us know in the comments give this video a like yes we love your feedback all right thank you insiders we'll see you next time keep it real tutorial insiders I love it

Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=0) |  - Hello insiders, today we're going to

talk about a new feature in YouTube analytics, to help you better understand your video retention on a totally new level. Today I'm gonna speak to Dan, who's working on this feature. Dan, do you wanna introduce yourself? - Absolutely. Hey, Lena. My name is Dan, I'm in interaction designer, on studio, and specifically, I work on analytics. - Cool, tell us a bit more, why did you decide to launch a new audience retention card  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=30) |  and what is the difference with the

old one? - [Dan] There is an audience retention graph today. But for one thing that only exists at the video level. There's not really a great way other than going into individual videos to compare audience retention across them. Additionally, it's not very visual and it can be difficult to interpret what that means for creator. We wanted to pick out some of what's happening

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=60) |  in that graph, in that line, that

it's describing, and surface those, moments, key moments is what we're calling them, for different videos. We're doing this at the channel level, as well as at the individual video level. - Okay, so what are those moments? - We've picked out four key moments and naming these was really hard, we went back and forth a lot on the names for these  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=90) |  but we ended up with, as the

intro, the first 30 seconds of the video and we know that's really important cause that's your chance to hook viewers. We're ranking that by the number of people still watching after 30 seconds. Secondly, we have continuous segments, which is when there's a period when the graph is basically flat, and that means really no one is leaving the videos, that indicates you haven't really engaging content there.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=120) |  Spikes and dips are the last two.

A spike could mean a couple of different things, it could mean either people are rewatching, that section, or there's a timestamp there, and viewers are getting linked to that point. A dip could mean a number of different things typically that people are leaving the video at that point where they're skipping over it. - This sounds really interesting, and do you have any tips about how creators can use this data? - Sure, definitely.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=150) |  We almost called this card "Highlights", we

went away from that because that implies good things are happening and these aren't necessarily always good. For example, if there's a spike people are rewatching a section, that could mean that it's a more engaging moment, or people think it's funny, or they wanna see it again but it could also mean that the audio cuts out, or there's something happening in the background that people are distracted by. What we're hoping is that by surfacing these key moments,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=180) |  and especially at the channel level, creators

can look across their videos and see what notable things are happening and find patterns in those. For continuous segments, those the longer they are, the better they are. We've ranked them from longest to shortest. If you have a really long continuous segment of viewers watching that typically means that's really engaging content. I would recommend watching that segment and kind of thinking about what's happening there,

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=210) |  what can you do with that information

to make more of that content in the future? The overarching question that we were looking to answer this feature is, what video should I make next? Hopefully, with this information creators can say, Okay, now I kind of have a sense for what's resonating with my audience, what they find really engaging and I can do more of that in the future. - All right, I have, very last question.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=240) |  Can everyone see this card? - Everyone

should be able to see the card. The videos show up are your most recent and if certain videos don't meet the criteria, for example, they have to be at least a minute long, I think, and a few other criteria. They won't show up in the list necessarily. - Do you have any questions for Creator Insider audience then? yes, kind of an invitation to weigh in on where this goes next. We're really excited about this.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9c6B2Wvpw&t=270) |  We think it has a lot of

potential for creators, but also we know that we can do a lot more with this and take it in a lot of different directions. We'd love to hear from folks what they wanna see next. We are excited to hear from them and incorporate that feedback into deciding what to do next with this. - Thanks for coming to the show then. - Thank you. - Try the new feature, leave your feedback and keep it real.

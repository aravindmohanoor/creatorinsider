#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=0) |  - Hello insiders, today I have a

very special guest. I have Zach from "The Try Guys" on the "Insider Nation". Welcome to the show, Zach. - Hey Tom, thanks for having me. I'm happy to be here and chat everything YouTube. - Yeah, man, it's cool having you here. Before we get into the channel, I would love to start with like life before becoming a YouTube creator, like what were you doing? You know, pre-"Try Guys"? - Oh, wow, pre-"Try Guys",  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=30) |  who can even remember that far back?

So I grew up, you know, when I was growing up, YouTube wasn't a thing yet. You know, the idea of being a YouTuber wasn't even a career aspiration that I could have imagined. I think I was a teenager when YouTube had started to come to the forefront, I grew up loving movies. I always had a passion for filmmaking. I was making little movies with my teddy bears in my bedroom, and always knew that I wanted to come out to L.A. to try and be a writer, director. In the years when I first moved out here,  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=60) |  I was working in the commercial production

circuit, so working as a PA and then working myself up in the coordinator route. So it was a lot of really wonderful experience witnessing some of the greatest directors of the modern era, you know, front row seat to watch them work. But I was frustrated, I was doing that for about two years and I had only gotten a chance to make a couple things on my own. And the stuff that I was making on my own I hated, it was this...  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=90) |  I'm sure I'll come back to this

idea throughout this talk, but "Hourglass" has this great talk about the gap, and it's when you're starting out as a young creative person, there's a gap between your taste, which is impeccable and your abilities, which typically is not that. And that creates a lot of frustration 'cause you go, "Oh, I know what I wanna make, I have these great ideas, but I can't do it." And frankly, it wasn't until I started my career in that video that I picked up that 10,000 hours  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=120) |  of experience and really was able to

hone my craft and get great at what I do. - So how did you go from leaving the film industry to then ending up at "BuzzFeed"? - I made a web series, I can't say it's great, it's my attempt to rip off the office. It was called "The Fresh Manager of Jaden Smith". I directed this three part series, it didn't do what I had hoped. You know, I thought like, "Great, I'm gonna make this series, Hollywood's gonna see it, come knocking on my door big time."  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=150) |  But what did happen is that in

trying to make this thing, I reached out to a lot of people. I reached out to my alumni network. I went to Emerson College, which is a great film production school. And a friend of mine, Ella, Ella Melnichenko, someone I kind of knew of in college, but we never crossed paths. She jumped on to help me produce, and she was the very first intern at "BuzzFeed's" video program. She's saying like, "Zach, come work at "BuzzFeed", Zach come work with me." I'm like, "I don't want to."  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=180) |  I did not know "BuzzFeed" at the

time, except for, you know, as the cat gift site. I didn't have a high opinion of it, I was a potential film school student, who was jaded and didn't wanna accept pop culture into my heart. I went there for three months thinking that I would just get some experience under my belt, learn about this new wild world of web video, maybe boost my reel and then move on. Within the first week, I was like, "Whoa, this is cool, something special is happening here,  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=210) |  and I wanna stay in this field

for a long time." - Wow, did you feel like you learned more at "BuzzFeed" than working with these like big time Hollywood studios? - Oh, absolutely. I learned, frankly, I learned more in two years at "BuzzFeed" than I learned in four years of film school. - Oh, wow. - It really felt like my grad school. - Do you remember like a experiment you ran  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=240) |  or like a new concept that you

started there that really exceeded your expectations, that you still look back on and you're like, "Wow, that was pretty good, I learned a lot on that thing and it really did way better than I thought it would do." - I mean, frankly, yeah. ""The Try Guys"." - Perfect segue. So, "The Try Guys" was birthed at "BuzzFeed"? - Yeah. - Then how does that work? Doesn't "BuzzFeed" like, was that a....  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=270) |  Why didn't it stay at "BuzzFeed" and

how did that transition happen? - Yeah, sure. So we around... So the four of us, Keith, Ned, Eugene and myself, we all started within about a month of each other. And we had been working there for eight months, really just trying to crack viral formats. Eight months in, we made the first video that would become "The Try Guys". It wasn't a series, it was just another in a long line of tests. And Keith and I made that video together, we cast ourselves and thought like,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xD7EO9Qnmtg/maxres1.jpg)



#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=300) |  "Hey, this could be a fun group

dynamic for this thing." It really took on a life of its own. There were some times where some of our higher ups were like, "Hey, maybe let's not have four producers working on one project." And we're like, "Yeah, yeah, absolutely." And then we just stayed late and did it anyway. It really was a passion project, I think a lot of people assume that we were cast or that it was some brainchild of an executive being like, "Oh, we need a four guys who will be willing to do anything." No, we just had a lot of fun doing it  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=330) |  and the audience loved it. I like

to say that we came up in the world's fastest and largest focus group. We didn't decide that we were a thing, the audience did. After about four years, look, I have nothing but good things to say about my time there. But I knew as a creative person and just as a human in general, I needed to leave to grow. So we all made the decision to leave, our contracts had expired and after a very friendly negotiation, we were able to purchase the IP from "BuzzFeed",  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=360) |  and they were gracious in letting us,

even giving us the opportunity to buy it from them. We launched a new channel and yeah, we're going a little over two years now and it's going really well. - Yeah, no doubt. So you're negotiating with "BuzzFeed", trying to get the IP, trying to get the name, I'm guessing while you're doing that, are you starting to put together your backlog of video ideas and produce stuff, or are you thinking, "Let's get this legal stuff sorted out before we can really work on it?"  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=390) |  - No, I mean, we basically started

filming, I think our final day at "BuzzFeed" was a Tuesday and we started filming videos on a Thursday. - Oh, wow! - Yeah, so we just hit the ground running. We like to do formats over just videos or vlogs, that's just what we like to make and what performs better for us. So we needed some runway, we made sure that we had done block shooting so that we had, I think a month and a half to two months worth of releases before we were ready to go live.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=420) |  And that's just because our videos take

longer than I would say the average YouTube video. On average, I think we're putting eight days of editing into each video, and that's really to ensure that they feel like these fully realized stories with a beginning, middle and end three X structure. A set up and pay off, character arcs, weaving the footage and the expert interviews in interesting ways, so that's just how we like to do things. - Yeah, it's interesting, 'cause sometimes you'll talk to people who they'll say,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=450) |  "Oh, well you work at YouTube, like

those creators they just turn on their camera and all of a sudden they're millionaires." And I try and tell 'em like, "Well, the ones that do really well, they take it super seriously and they'll spend, you know, weeks on a video sometimes." Tell me about that first upload? - It was just the most thrilling thing. You know, what was really interesting is that because of the strength frankly of your algorithm, we were able to get back to our view threshold pretty quickly.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=480) |  You know, we did a very intense

social blasting strategy, but basically our videos were being engaged with on our new channel more or less the same way they had been on "BuzzFeed's" channel. So the algorithm was feeding it to people, it was saying, "Hey, if you like watching "Try Guy's" videos, you might like watching this new thing, that to us seems a lot like "The Try Guys" video." 'Cause it was us. But for the first couple months, you know, we had our first wave of subscribers and then we really plateaued and it was like,  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=510) |  "We're getting all these views but people

aren't subscribing." And it became clear to us that because of the way the algorithm worked, people didn't even realize that it was a new channel. They were just like, "Oh cool, new video." No one knew that we had left. So it wasn't until we made an explicit, I think about a couple months in, we made a video that explicitly stated, "Hey, this is a new company, this is a new channel." And we saw, I think over a million subscribers in a day. - Did you have to change it up significantly  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=540) |  from the "BuzzFeed" days? Or is your

channel something where you're, I guess you're.... are you always trying new formats? Like what's the cycle of kind of the creative process? - We knew two things, making a new channel, we would have to radically up our input. We used to be one video every two weeks, on our channel we're two videos a week now, three videos a week throughout this quarantine. So we wanted to have more videos than ever before because we know that that's necessary for the health of the algorithm, but we also wanted to have as good a quality  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=570) |  if not better than when we were

under a large corporation. So we really challenged ourselves to make something very high quality. - So let's talk a little bit about you must have Emerson Alumni and friends say like, "Hey Zach, I love what you're doing, I wanna do it too. You know, what's the secret, how do you succeed on YouTube?" What advice do you give people when they're starting out and they wanna, you know, kind of follow in your footsteps.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xD7EO9Qnmtg/maxres2.jpg)



#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=600) |  - There are certain things I can

tell people about what does and doesn't work and how to optimize their content, but ultimately you learn through doing and just getting in there, getting your hands dirty, making a lot of content. Yeah, you have to learn trial by fire. - Could you give an example of something you've seen another YouTube creator do, or through your work with them that you're like, "Ah, you know, that's a really cool approach, we should think about, you know, something like that or rethink some assumptions that we have?"  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=630) |  - Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I mean, "Good

Mythical Morning", they, I wanna say, they film out a month's worth of videos in four days or maybe in a week. And then that's their, I don't know if I'm outing like their company secret, but they block shoot it, they are so efficient with how they film. Meanwhile, we, you know, sometimes we'll take two days on one video, we'll do 10, 20 minutes for pre-thoughts where I'm trying to find the perfect joke, and we only use 30 seconds of that footage  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=660) |  from all four of us, like we

are wildly inefficient. And so some of that we wanna keep because that's the process of discovery and we think that our videos are great from it, but seeing how they worked, we were like, "Okay, we need to figure out a block shooting system and have like... It led to, in part we do these game-time videos, where it us hanging out on onesies, it's a little more relaxed and it's because we realized, "Okay, we can shoot two or three of these in a day,  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=690) |  they're really fun for the audience and

then we can have those concentrated that then allows us to take on these bigger projects, and then on the cadence of our release, we can kind of oscillate between the two different types of videos and have big video, a little video, a big video, little video. - I wanted to touch a little bit on your experience using YouTube as a creator in terms of the tools we offer, or you mentioned the algorithm. What feedback do you have for us that you can be candid and straightforward,  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=720) |  like what do you think we're doing

well that you'd like us to continue doing as it relates to helping creators, and then what do you think you wanna see, you know, you'd like to see us do more of or do a better job at? - Well, I have to pay my respects to the algorithm, it giveth and it taketh away. We've had a mostly really positive experience, I mean, part of it, I think is because we began first as just students of trying to understand how it worked,  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=750) |  and that's informed a lot of our

creative decisions. Something that's been really helpful that you guys rolled out recently, I don't know if everyone has this is, is the "GLENDA Program", which allows us to upload videos prior and you kinda see if anything would get demonetized. We do some borderline stuff sometimes. We made a DUI series, we did stoned driving, we got stoned on camera, not demonetized.  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=780) |  We were like, "What is going on?"

Then we did an ear wax extraction video and that was deemed as an invasive surgery, which I still disagree with, I think you guys are wrong about that. - Would you say most of your concerns or feedback for us is around policy and the actual sort of technology and products are working okay for you, or do you also feel like the products and the tools and the features are not working as well as they could?  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=810) |  - I've had a pretty good experience

with the features and tools. Look, I know that there's a team of really passionate people who are working really hard over there to frankly make the experience as good for creators as possible, because what's good for us as good for you guys and there is a symbiotic relationship there. Everyone that I've spoken to on the team really cares passionately about what they're doing and is trying to make it better. I think the things that I wonder about  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=840) |  and that I hope for the future

of the platform, is just that you guys, and not you specifically, Tom, but as a company, you guys have a tremendous responsibility. And I think it's a responsibility of precedent that frankly technology is advancing faster than society and government can understand. And so you guys need to be the ones that really dictate, what does it look like to be a responsible company in the modern era? What does it look like to decide  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=870) |  what voices get to thrive and not?

The future of deep fakes terrifies me, the things that have happened with children's content. I mean, I know that you guys have been through it and you are constantly trying to do the right thing, but these are tremendous choices with a lot of responsibility and they're not easy choices, they're not black and white. So I know that there's a... it's not a position I envy. And I know that the people on the inside  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xD7EO9Qnmtg/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=900) |  are really doing what they can to

try and navigate those as intelligently and as fairly as they can, but that's the challenge for the future, right? Is how do you be an ethical company in the modern world? - You know, I can say that I think our leadership and as a company, I think we're taking that responsibility really, really seriously. And trying to think, you know, decades out. - Yeah. - Because to your point,  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=930) |  you know, what we do does sort

of demonstrate one way of doing it and, you know, can be a form of precedent for other stakeholders. I remember when I first joined the company four years ago, you know, even in my early days at YouTube, like I kept hearing like responsible growth and responsible policies and, you know, there's this kind of much longer term vision than maybe is typical for other places.  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=960) |  So I was impressed by that and

I think we're, you know-- - By the way, when I hear Susan talk, I'm like, "Wow, this is someone who understands the complexities of the situation and cares." And by the way, there may be some incorrect decisions made between now and the end of time, but it's clear to me that it's being made in the interest of doing the right thing. - It's hard, it's like a Rubik's cube. There's rarely like, "Oh, well, obviously we should do that." 'Cause you know, there's always like all these other perspectives.  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=990) |  Last question, if you had to either

ask YouTube anything, is there anything that you wanted to kinda hit me up with that I can kinda try and shed some light on? - Oh man, this is gonna haunt me, I'm gonna to wake up at like three in the morning and be like, "Why didn't I ask him this?" you know something that we've been thinking about lately, and this is actually (mumbles) we have is that, we have been told by you guys that one video bombing  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1020) |  does not affect the videos thereafter. That

the algorithm sees every video as unique and experientially, I can say that's not true. We had, you know, our average is about one to 1.2, 1.6 in a day, we had one video that was an experiment of ours, and for us bombed I wanna say, it's a four to 600,000 view video. And as a result, our next four releases were much below our average  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1050) |  and we finally just recovered from that.

By the way, I know the video that did bad, I know why it did bad I get that. But I think a lot of people are freaked out about stuff like that, it discourages this sense of experimentation. - That's a really good question. I would point to a couple of things. Like, I think the inverse... you experienced the inverse where you started a new channel and you didn't tell us like, "Hey, this is from the "BuzzFeed" guys."  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1080) |  And we were able to notice that,

wow, this video is doing well, we're gonna recommend it more, even though that channel probably didn't have many uploads in its history. - Right. - And so at least from there you know that there is an atomic kind of principle working with recommendations and we don't sort of you know, require that a video come from a channel that has like this long history. I think for the more recent example,  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1110) |  I mean, do you not accept the

possibility that the subsequent four videos just, you know, we're not as good as your typical videos? - They may not have been as good, it's very possible man, that was good. And look, I know that there's a human factor to this too, where maybe they saw, humans saw this video and went, "Ah, well, the last one was kind of a throw away, so maybe the next ones, maybe they're like churning out not good content now." Definitely a possibility.  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1140) |  - Do you guys go into the

the analytics? Did you look at the click through rate and average view duration for the four subsequent ones? - I didn't in this case, I have in the past. - If you find that your four subsequent ones or, you know, if someone on your team wants to take a look and you're like, "No, look, Tom, the click through rate and view duration is as high as the previous 10, and it's just because of this one bomb that you guys, you know, punished us." I'd love to take a look at that.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1170) |  But if you find out that actually

the performance numbers were on the weaker side, then you can tell other people and be like, "Hey, you know, it's not all, you know, sometimes it's just the audience doesn't vibe with the video." - And we'll have a friend build like a nice fruit basket or something, I get it. - There you go. Well, Zach, thank you for stopping by the "Insider" channel, it was great hearing your story, and thank you for sharing all the advice for other creators out there, because I know there's tons of people who wanna learn  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1200) |  from your experience and are big supporters

of what you guys are doing at "Try Guys", so keep up the great work and thanks for keeping it real. - My pleasure, thanks for having me. And hey, to anyone watching, like just keep making stuff, that's the best thing that you can do. Become a student of thumbnails and titles and understand what success looks like, but at the end of the day, you're not gonna be satisfied if you're just chasing other people's success. - If I had a cup of tea, I would toast to you right now. - Cheers. - Oh shit, all right.  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD7EO9Qnmtg&t=1230) |  I'll find some, here we go, I

got a little-- - Hey, here it is. - A little chai tea baby (laughs).

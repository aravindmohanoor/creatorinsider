#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=0) |  - Hey insiders in this Week's News

Flash is gonna be straight to the point. This is official updates from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators. We got some great feedback from Mark. You can see a video and the description with a couple of tips around audience retention and part of that is keeping your intros. (snapping fingers) Direct into the point. So let's get into it. First update we have this week is around chat support. Now, if you were watching in August, this did come up, you can check out that video,  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=30) |  their link in the description. What we're

doing is rolling out a pilot whereby chat support will be available via studio. Now, monetizing creators always had the option to access chat support via the help center, but obviously it's an awful lot easier if you can just do it within your working environment, If you're eligible for this pilot, what you'll see is a little chat icon that will appear beside the help button. Who's this available to? Well, firstly, to a select number of YouTubers  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=60) |  who have set their language as English.

And we'll be rolling it out to a couple of other languages `as well. Next update. Update number two, we have the creator research program. Now last week, Jalisa and Abhinav talked about creator research program. They're still on the lookout for it specifically mobile first creators. So make sure you follow the instructions below to reach out to research team, to become part of that program.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=90) |  Update number three, terms of service. Some

of these were updated last week, but there are two things that we wanna call out specifically. The first is that YouTube restricts third parties from collecting data, which could be used for the purposes of facial recognition. Now our position on this hasn't changed. However, the technology in this area has developed significantly. And that's why we're updating the language to make sure that we're explicit. That we're very clear on this point. YouTube restricts third parties from collecting data,  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=120) |  which could be used for the purposes

of facial recognition. Point number two, on terms of service, the platform has the right to monetize all content on the platform and payments to partners who monetize on the platform are going to be regarded as royalties from US tax perspective. We're gonna link to a forum below within the description, which provides much more detailed update. Take a look through  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=150) |  these things are really important to understand.

And next step we have is around featured channels. Now, what are they? Well, the first thing to know is they allow creators to showcase specific channels within their own channel. Now what's changed previously that had been located on the right hand side of the desktop version of a channel. What's changing now is that is gonna be effectively like any other featured element of a channel and or featured section of a channel  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=180) |  to make it more consistent across mobile

and desktop. So make sure you visit your channel page to convert that section into any other featured section. The next step we have pins chats. What are they? They allow a creator to pin their own chart or a fan's chart to put it in a more prominent position. Now, what is the good news here? Well, it's rolling edge to 100% of creators. We really hope you enjoy this feature. And next update we have your leaving YouTube message.

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=210) |  Now this is about the safety of

the platforms users and what the message will do is it will say you are leaving YouTube. It'll ask you to confirm that hey! you want to do this. Number two, that you trust the link that you clicked on. All of this is part of the platform's mission to keep everybody safe while using YouTube. So make sure you leave some feedback in the comments below. All right, next up, we had some exciting news around user testing. This is around the data that appears beside  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=240) |  the subscriptions alert. Now, currently today, that

dot is red like this, but what we wanna test out is a new dot, which is going to be blue like this. Now why we're doing this is to better differentiate between the notifications alert and the subscribers alert or rather subscriptions alert. The alert that tells you that there's been a new upload from one of your subscriptions. We'll be testing it out over the next little while.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=270) |  Let us know if you have any

feedback in the comments below. We'd be delighted to know if it's having the desired impact. All right, next up, we have exciting news about YPP appeals by video. Now, if you don't remember Barbara and Joscelyn going into a little bit of detail, or our engine experiment on this last year, we'll leave a link to that video in the description. So what's happening? Well, for those about may have been suspended from YPP.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=300) |  What's gonna happen is in this experiment

is moving into a beta phase. Now how this impacts this community is that it's gonna be integrated into studio. So not only will you be able to appeal by video via studio, you'll also get more granular feedback on the appeal once a decision has been made. Now this is gonna be available on a very limited basis at the beginning, but those who have been suspended from YPP

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=330) |  and are eligible for this appeal path,

will be able to access it for the moment and tell us a lot more about your content. What happens once you make that video to give our policy team more context about your channel, your content and how you approach the platform? Well, the policy team will review that added context. And if your appeal shows that your channel complies with our policies, we'll turn that monetization back on  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=360) |  for your channel before the end of

the 30 day suspension window. We'll keep you updated with how this is going. If you're eligible and your experiencing this really cool application path, keep us updated with how it's going for you. Leave us some feedback in the comments below. This week's question comes from Emresinho Powerlifting. Sorry that I'm not pronouncing that correctly. Who asks, I am very curious about locations in which videos are recommended.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=390) |  I do English videos to reach more

globally people but 99% of my content is recommended in Switzerland (where I'm living) which is mostly German speaking. How to get recommended in other countries? Well, we took this question back to Rachel who wrote the following reply. Interesting, we don't restrict a video's exposure to the uploaders country. Our systems respond to viewer demand. So you must be making something  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=420) |  that Swiss viewers, really like. (claps) It

all comes down to the audience. So maybe you could do some market research into the types of videos viewers in these other countries want. and or what they're watching. You can use trends.google.com, filtering to YouTube search. Try using that, to see what topics viewers in your target countries may be looking for. So again, we've shifted from the traditional trivia questions to answering your questions.  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSoXux3pco&t=450) |  So if you have a question, make

sure to pop it into the comments below and we'll pick one a week certainly for the next couple of weeks. From the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators. I've been Connor. This has been creator insider and your Weekly News Flash. See you next week.

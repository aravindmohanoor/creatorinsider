Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=0) |  hello insiders I'm chin I'm a product

specialist of notifications today we'll be talking about some upcoming changes to notifications I know a topic that is very well sought out for and then also talk about some improvements we're making but before we get started I wanted to introduce james hi I'm james I'm the product manager for notifications at youtube all right james I know this is not your first time on this channel but for our new subscribers mind give me a quick overview on what your team has been working on in the notification space yeah I think the  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=30) |  the big change we talked about last

time we were on creature insider was some updates to youtube analytics to sort of help creators understand a little bit more about how their notifications are working so it's worth just recapping that because I know the creators that use it have found it really really powerful and insightful and not all creators are using it so it's worth flagging that there's there's two cards we added one was a channel level card so it shows the percent of subscribers that have turned on notifications for your channel and have enabled youtube notifications and there's also a video level card so  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=60) |  for your latest video upload you can

see how many notifications were sent the click-through rate for these notifications and how they contribute to views to the performance of that particular video so if you haven't used those cards i'd encourage you to have a look and you can kind of see how well these notifications are working for you thank you james yeah I know a lot of creators are very excited about these these cards and these messages but like to james point if you haven't seen it we'll we'll put a help center link down below so with that we're back quick overview thank you on that part tell us james what's next we talked just  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=90) |  a second ago about push notifications but

within the kind of the remit of my teams we also send email and as many of you kind of perhaps reported or noticed we sent quite a lot of email particularly for for uploads and we heard creator and viewer feedback that maybe we're sending too many of certain types and so we wanted to evaluate this and see if we could make that email channel you know more effective and maybe get rid of some of the noise essentially we send today we send push notifications for your latest upload  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=120) |  and we also send an accompanying email

of a if a viewer has hit the bell and actually what we found is that something like less than 0.1 of the the new upload emails are actually opened and clicked back to youtube and so then we start asking ourselves you know is email the best format for these kinds of updates and maybe actually we should be looking at things like push notifications and deferring back to the other subscriber tools you know things like the subscriptions feed the notifications inbox and so we ran an experiment to turn off these emails and we ran this for a long time we were  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=150) |  trying to really understand how how well

they work so around a three month experiment and assess the impact of if we turn off these emails does it affect creators does it affect viewers you know for small channels big channels and that kind of thing and so what we found is actually if we turn off emails for your new uploads there's no measurable loss of views for any channel both these huge kind of mcm channels and they're right the way down to you know small channels that are just starting out and actually what's interesting we found is actually a very marginal small increase in views  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=180) |  and so we wanted to understand this

a little bit better so if we turn off emails actually it looks like some videos are performing better and so as I said we did this kind of channel size slicing and we really dug into the experiments and we also so we validated actually what tends to happen is people tend to use push notifications a little bit more when you start the emails and they do tend to come back to the app and consume more videos the other thing we want to understand is you know how creators might feel about this change and so we floated this with a you know a creative kind of focus group and  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=210) |  again we spoke to small and large

creators to help us make this decision and they told us that actually they don't see email as being critical to the success of their video and so we have we're planning to turn off these emails thank you for that explanation james let me help me understand and help the group understand this so you're saying if we turn off these emails it seems like we will experiment how will this change kind of how subscribers interact with youtube yeah so it's worth mentioning there essentially there are a few other ways that and I kind of mentioned some a  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=240) |  second ago that subscribers your subscribers know

about your new video so we send lots of push notifications and I should make it really clear we have no plans to change those and by those I mean the one the little messages that are sent to your phone they appear you know on android ios or chrome we have no no plans to change those at all there's of course the subs feed you know the subs box as some of you may call it and then alongside that there's the notifications inbox and we have no plans to change any of those three mechanisms and they all work really well and actually what happens is I think  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=270) |  that the emails tend to get lost

in email inboxes you know we get lots of them tools like gmail now may put some of the youtube emails under a social tab so it might be hidden and so actually email doesn't look that effective and so when you turn them off what happens is that people tend to go and seek out the the alternative channels whether it's the subs feed the notifications or the notifications inbox we have more come back to the app and visit the subscriptions page which is what this chart's showing is showing that there's a kind of a modest increase the blue line between the version where we we turn off the

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=300) |  emails and the version where we retain

the emails and this blue line essentially says that you know in the version when we turn off the emails the subscription page visitors go up a little bit and so actually the people are coming back to the app and they're looking at thing in this example we're looking at the subscriptions page and they're seeking out your videos there and we think that's a better experience and which is why we want to turn off these emails and there's another interesting thing we observed is that as as more people are kind of live streaming with the kind of lockdowns  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=330) |  in many countries and you know the

recent sort of covered issues we've all been through we've seen live streams increase and and live stream you know sending an email for a live stream doesn't make a lot of sense and we saw that essentially these typically emails get opened many hours after we send them you know I think in the case of livestreams it's around three hours and so sending an email that gets open three hours after you've live stream doesn't really work for these streams and so a push notification that tends to get opened almost immediately it's a kind of a better product fit for helping your subs  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=360) |  become aware of this your latest stream

or your latest upload so generally we think that the push notifications the subs tab and the inbox are just a better solution for keeping your subscribers up to date that that sounds like a really great trend in terms of like these experiment results but also just the kind of like high level how subscribers are interacting with youtube in general I have to ask for all the creators out there are there any other ways this is going to affect creators one of the things we observed is that you know many creators  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=390) |  use the same email account as a

viewer and as a creator so it's the same youtube login and so your email inbox and many of you may be able to relate to this has both all of your emails all of these bells and then maybe you're also the arguably much more critical stuff you know strikes community guidelines which is very important to creators obviously and so we wanted to maybe clean up the email inbox to really help surface these messages that are more critical to to you as a channel and so we feel that  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=420) |  you know we can get rid of

some of the noise from youtube overall and really highlight some of the these more important emails hopefully that's a better change for creators in general well it sounds like we're we're kind of rolling forward on this just kind of curious there's a lot of emails out there how do you plan on turning this off yeah so it turns out turning down a campaign of the sizes takes a little bit of time and you would we've been trying to work through it in a thoughtful way and so we will stop sending these

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=450) |  subscriber notifications and as I said we'll

continue to send push notifications to mobile devices to chrome browsers and then we also want to make sure that there's a very small percentage of people to open them and we're going to send them a sort of farewell email explaining to your subscribers and your viewers who may be using them what the alternatives are that we're turning them off and how they can still find your videos and so we'll be sending them you know help center articles and some guidance there to help them out  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=480) |  excellent thanks for the thanks for the

update james I think it's good that we're all also trying to make sure that the subscribers of all these channels are well informed and they know kind of where to where to go next and how to still consume the same content that they've always been consuming off of these channels so after that I'm kind of curious when the next time you're in creator insider or specifically have what's next for notifications as I mentioned during covid we've seen quite a lot of increasing live streams and premieres and we want to help people  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=510) |  discover these live streams obviously live streams

are very timely you know we want to make sure that your subs are kind of showing up exactly as they start and so we've actually shipped quite a few changes recently to support these streams and sort of trying to aid the discovery of the live streams the other piece kind of related to that is around the live stream reminder so that's the sort of manual toggle you can set for a specific stream and that will then send you a reminder when it starts and and we wanted to ship some  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=540) |  reliability changes there to bring them up

to the same reliability standard that we've brought the bell up to in the last year or so and so now you know we have the same kind of reliability metrics that we track internally to make sure that these things are working perfectly and so we're really happy with the way that the reminders work now and then the third kind of a viewer and a creator fix we're thinking about the inbox so the inbox tab in the youtube main app we're looking at how we can help people find their latest updates help your subscribers find the most recent bell for example within  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNQRhA7xos&t=570) |  that tab and generally just considering some

improvements there so that's something we're looking at next third time is a charm so hopefully once we kind of roll those out that you can come join us on creator insider again to talk about all these changes perfect well that's a wrap for today so please please please put feedback on for anything that you want in terms of james comments concerns etc in the comments below if you like this video don't forget to thumbs up this video and until next time bye all thanks

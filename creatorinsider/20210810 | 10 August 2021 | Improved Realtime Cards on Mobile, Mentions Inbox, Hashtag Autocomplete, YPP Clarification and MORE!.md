#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTr80-nBPOA&t=0) |  - What's up insiders, that's right you've

tuned in this week's news flash. The quick, succinct, set of updates that you need to navigate the world of YouTube's product features, as well as its policies. Now, what have we got for you this week? We have clarification, we have reminders, we have launches, so let's get into it. First up, we have a launch, the improved real-time card experience on iOS and Android. Now, what is this exactly what it sounds like? It's an improved real-time card experience, the video level and up the channel level for iOS and Android.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTr80-nBPOA&t=30) |  And what this is, is part of

an effort, that we call feature parody. Trying to make sure that these cards align with what you see on Web, as well as what you see on mobile. Making sure that they're really comparable experiences. Let us know if you have any feedback in the comments below. Next up, we have another launch, and that is, for the mentions inbox on studio desktop. Now, what this involves is, the addition of another tab, collaboratively called Mentions in the studio comments inbox on desktop.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTr80-nBPOA&t=60) |  What this is going to show you

is all the places that you as a creator have been mentioned. Now let's pivot from launches to a reminder. This reminder is pretty spectacular. Dark theme is available on studio desktop. Now this means that you're able to navigate through your content and your channel with a dark background and light text. Why is this important? Well, it reduces eyestrain and glare all day rent. Now let's pivot back to a launch. This one is called hashtag auto-complete suggestions.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTr80-nBPOA&t=90) |  Creators of the past couple of months

have told us that they welcomed an awful lot more guidance around how to best use hashtags on the platform. And with this feature, we're hoping to fill that gap. What this feature will do is suggest hashtags that are more popular on the platform for your videos to help make them more searchable and more discoverable. This is going to be launched on available on creator studio, iOS, Android, desktop, on YouTube main App, iOS, Android,  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTr80-nBPOA&t=120) |  as well as on VOD and within

the shorts upload flow. Check out that link in the description below. Now let's talk about something that's a little bit closer to my daily work, and that is eligibility requirements to apply for YPP. The YouTube partner program, high creators make money on YouTube. Now in order to be eligible to apply, you need to have 1,000 subscribers and at least 4,000 hours of watch time within the last 12 months. On top of this, you need to make sure that you don't have any active strikes on your channel.

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTr80-nBPOA&t=150) |  Now, if you do have an active

strike on your channel, you're going to need to wait for that to have expired or for it to have been overturned before you can apply to YPP. Okay folks, we made it through another set of updates and that means that I get to approach my favorite part of each of these updates and that is your question. So this week's question comes from TheWaffleGalaxy. Huge kudos for such a cool channel name. It says, it would be great  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTr80-nBPOA&t=180) |  to have a recent super thanks module

on the creator dashboard. Good point. That way we can see and engage with any super thanks that come in easier, great point. Well, we brought this to the team and they replied with the problem. Good news. You can already do this to interact with viewers that purchase super thanks comments. Go to the comment section of YouTube studio and filter for super thanks. Thanks. You can reply to the comments directly there. Okay. We hope this is clearer for you.

YouTube creators. That has been your weekly newsflash. See you next week.

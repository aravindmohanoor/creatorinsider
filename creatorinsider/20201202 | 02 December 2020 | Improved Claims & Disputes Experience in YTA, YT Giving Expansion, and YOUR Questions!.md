#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjrCCbMb1o&t=0) |  - All right, Insiders, only a couple

of updates this week. This is your weekly newsflash, everything that's happening inside of YouTube that you wanna know about. Let's get into it. Okay, our first update this week is about improving claims and disputes information inside of YouTube Analytics. Now, up until now, there's been no information provided within YouTube Analytics about claims and disputes. Useful information would typically include whether the claim has been disputed,

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjrCCbMb1o&t=30) |  whether that has been won or lost,

and whether the revenue will be back-filled. Now, this can cause an awful lot of frustration- simply having a claim made on your content- because you'll make a huge amount of effort producing your great content and you'll expect to see some sort of revenue return and with a claim, you'll see that revenue drop, right? So, the change here is building all of that useful information into YouTube Analytics at the video level.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjrCCbMb1o&t=60) |  On top of this, what the team

is gonna be providing is more options at that video level. One of those options will be disputing right from inside YouTube Analytics. Now, the best part of this is it's gonna save you an awful lot of time. If you have any feedback for us, make sure you leave it in the comments below. We send those comments right back to the team that's made this possible and we make sure that your feedback is heard.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjrCCbMb1o&t=90) |  Next up, our last update for this

week is around YouTube Giving. This is a launch. What we're doing is making YouTube Giving accessible to any monetizing channel with over 10,000 subscribers in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. All eligible channels already have access, so this is something that you should see live on the platform right now. And lastly, we have a question from one of you, one of the Creator Insider community.

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjrCCbMb1o&t=120) |  So, this one is from The Roaming

Jhola and they ask, "My channel is monetized. However, I don't turn on monetization for every video of mine. Is it true that monetized videos have more likelihood of being recommended than non-monetized videos?" Well, Roaming Jhola, I can clear up this myth. There is absolutely no impact on what is recommended when it comes to monetization  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjrCCbMb1o&t=150) |  being enabled at the video level. They're

completely separate systems and there is absolutely no connection between the two. So, we're really glad to clear up some of the confusion, some of the myths, some of the stuff that you always really just wanted to ask somebody at YouTube. And that's why our new slogan is "From the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators." You have a direct line to the teams that make all of the products and features possible on the platform. So, if you want your question answered,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGjrCCbMb1o&t=180) |  make sure you drop it in the

comments below and we'll address it next week. I've been Conor, this is Creator Insider, have a great week.

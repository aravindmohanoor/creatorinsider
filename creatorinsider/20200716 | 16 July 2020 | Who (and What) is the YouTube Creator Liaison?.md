Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=0) |  hello insiders this is Todd and today

I'm here with a special guest Matt he may be a familiar face to some of you but if not we hope you'll get to know him today he is a former creator himself who has turned into a YouTube employee and has been at the company for a number of years now he most recently headed up the YouTube creators official channel and now he's transitioning into a new role that I think is gonna be pretty  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=30) |  interesting for creators to hear about so

Matt why don't you introduce yourself first of all there's a lot of pressure here because I'm a low-energy guy I don't have that that same Tom energy but I'm gonna try to bring it yes I was an active creator from about 2008 to 2012 I was in our very first Nextup program before I was hired by YouTube as a Content strategist so I I met Google employees for the first time in the next up program and later I was hired so I  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=60) |  did the content strategy role for a

few years and then I led the team behind our official creators channel you know the other channel and now I'm in this new somewhat experimental role as a creator liaison interesting so maybe before we get into that we could talk a little bit about your experience as a creator how did you initially get into YouTube and is there any advice you want to share with people who are just getting started sure I was a film school guy I went out to LA to make movies and wrote  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=90) |  screenplays and I was very much a

behind the camera type editor camera operator and then I stumbled on YouTube and I realized there was huge potential there but I had to get in front of the camera which initially was a challenge for me but I just kept shoving myself out there and I tell funny stories I wore women's wigs you know typical YouTube stuff wait a second you wore wigs is this still up

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=120) |  on YouTube I don't think so I

think it was deleted Kevin if you're able get your elbows off the table okay you can just tell me you're not to sing it well a good tune will help you remember that's not proper etiquette as for advice I think Tom said it best in his goodbye video it's a little bit of a cliche but it really comes down to passion if you are not passionate about making these videos and talking about this week after week you're just going to run out of gas eventually so that is  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=150) |  absolutely number one make sure this is

a topic that you can talk about for a long time that you love to talk about I actually tried to experiment with other channels based on trends I was seeing and things that look like oh wow this is really blowing up I'm gonna try to make a channel about this and I petered out after a few months just because it turned into a grind and I just wasn't into the content at all so make sure you love it so you've been leading the  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=180) |  YouTube creators official channel for a while

would love to get your take on creator insider as a channel what you think about it and just sort of what was it like what did you enjoy most about running the YouTube creators channel there's a lot of fun I had come off of being a Content strategist for YouTube for several years so I was writing best practices for all channels and coming up with what it takes to build an audience  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=210) |  with the YouTube channel in general and

then I had a chance to get my hands on one channel again after four or five years of not really touching my own channel so it was a lot of fun to to just apply those best practices that I had been writing and it really took off I mean the channel went from 300,000 subs and is up to like two hundred or two million now not two hundred million so what do we be doing over here on creator insider - yeah I love the

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=240) |  scrappiness of this channel in authenticity at

first I had as like a film guy I was a little taken back by the scrappiness and the bad lighting and sometimes bad audio but it I've come to believe it's really filling a need for YouTube I like that we have both we have the official kind of fancy we have the really raw just tell it like it is creator insider Channel I think my main advice to you all as you probably know Todd is that I think the the information  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=270) |  needs to be more concise you all

used to go on and on for about 20 minutes per video and I think you've you've made it more concise now just kind of compacted the information down to five to ten minutes and I believe the audience has responded in a positive way I don't know somebody told me that the algorithm likes long videos but I guess they were wrong those conspiracy theories alright so so now you're you're done with  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=300) |  YouTube creators role for now and you're

moving into this creator liaison role what's a creator of the A's on what are you working on this year the goal of the job is to help creators better understand why YouTube make certain decisions and also to help YouTube better hear creator feedback and I think we've heard for years that we've needed a role like this and so I'm taking a crack at it it's somewhat experimental  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=330) |  I'm jumping in and in my experience

in my opinion there's always been a bit of a disconnect between the creator experience and the YouTube employee experience employees are incredibly smart people they're doing their very best for creators genuinely but the majority of them have never experienced the highs and lows of running a channel of their own sort of the rush of a viral  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=360) |  video or the sting of getting a

negative comment and frankly the fluctuations in monthly income are our salaries don't fluctuate if anything they slightly go up over the years and so it's a very different experience on the other side most creators have never worked with or been a part of a global tech company that has all these really complex responsibilities to users to advertisers to you know government regulations so  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=390) |  leaders don't really see the complexities of

supporting millions of channels versus their one channel so that's where I'm trying to come in to help employees better understand the creator experience and help creators really understand all the complexities around 500 hours uploaded per minute so you're helping creators kind of empathize with the people who are behind YouTube and trying to make it better  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=420) |  creators may not have all that context

of complexity in dealing with YouTube at scale with lots of different stakeholders and help YouTube employees like really put themselves in the shoes and empathize with creators who have a very different day-to-day experience makes sense so creators have something they want to share with you you know a concern comes up what's the best way for them to connect with you and get get their  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=450) |  concerns onto your radar well I'm operating

from a new twitter handle called youtube liaison and the best way to reach me is to tag me there with feedback it's a bit of a challenge because I can't as one person I can't support people with individuals issues like addy monetized video or something like that and that has come up a lot you know I've tried to help people here and there but the real handle to tag is Team YouTube for that sort of thing but  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=480) |  definitely if you have some feedback or

you're seeing you're seeing a lot of feedback from other creators just tag me I see just about everything I think and so let me know they're on my DMU I might ask questions in reply to clarify what you're seeing all right well thanks Matt for helping YouTube keep it real I hope that you will be spending a lot more time on the cool creative channel at YouTube creator insider and yeah I'm  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWKhz-fk5TA&t=510) |  sure people will continue to visit your

old YouTube creators channel as well thanks for coming on and good luck in the new role thanks for having me

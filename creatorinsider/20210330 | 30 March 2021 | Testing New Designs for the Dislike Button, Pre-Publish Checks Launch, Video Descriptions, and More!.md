We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=0) |  - Hey YouTubers. This is Creator Insider

on our weekly news flash. The best place for you to find out, what's happening on YouTube, direct from the tech team. Now, if you're new, make sure that you subscribe. So our first update, is around testing new designs for the like and dislike buttons. Now feedback has always been, a huge part of YouTube, and it will continue to be, but we've heard that the dislike accounts, can affect creator wellbeing, and sometimes are part  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=30) |  of the motivated campaign to target a

creator's upload. So we're testing designs that remove the count, behind dislikes. This is in an effort to improve the creator experience, but also to ensure that viewer feedback is still accounted for, and shared back to the creator. What does that mean for creators and viewers? Well, creators, you will still see, the like and dislike counts in YouTube studio, and viewers, you'll still be able to like and dislike videos if you're

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=60) |  in these experiments and, you'll still be

able to tune the recommendations that YouTube provides you with, as a result. Now we want as much feedback as possible. So, you know the drill, make sure you leave a comment below, if you've strong feelings either way. All right. That's likes and dislikes out of the way, we wanna get to an exciting launch. These are already pre-published checks. Now this is a feature, that Assaf and Ann referred to, on the channel, in previous months. If you're not familiar,  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=90) |  make sure you check out a link

in the description below. But the great news is, that these pre-published checks, have launched to 100% of channels. Next up, we have a really great announcement, where we're running an experiment on video descriptions. Now, last October, we announced that we were moving video descriptions on mobile, into their own panel. Quite similar to comments. What we're doing, as part of this experiment, is adding new sections to the description, such as chapters or featured games.

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=120) |  And what we're doing as part of

this experiment as well, is experimenting with how the description text appears. The text that you write for your description will still appear at the top of the panel, but the text will display as a preview by default. Viewers can still click and expand on this if they want to read the entire description. This next update, is something I'm really excited about. It's one of my favorite parts about the mobile experience, and that is Explore,  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=150) |  launched in March of 2020. This is

something that we're now bringing to desktop. So over the coming days, users will see trending, in the guide switched to Explore. Now it's still gonna be the location of things like, creators on the rise and artists on the rise, as well as destinations like, gaming and learning. We're doing this to make sure that we have a more seamless experience, between desktop and mobile. Make sure you leave any feedback you have in the comments below. All right. Next up we have a really exciting experiment,

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=180) |  and this is one that's called, Watch

YouTube on Twitter. Now Twitter is running, a one month experiment of its own, which we'll see, YouTube links converted into the YouTube embedded player for 1% of IOS viewers, in specific countries. That is just about it on this week's news flash, but I didn't wanna go, until I addressed an audience question, and this week, our question comes from David Marsden who commented,  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=210) |  underneath our video about hateful and derogatory

content, as part of our series, to dig in, to the advertiser friendly guidelines, and provide some context and guidance through the lens of self-certification. Now David asks, "What about self derogatory humor "and self hate?" "Because most British humor would be banned?" So being Irish, I'm more than familiar with self derogatory humor. That's a huge part of my culture. And I can say that that is perfectly fine to run ads  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b9sDOXZj-4&t=240) |  but, some tips would be making sure

that you don't use extreme profanity, and you don't make jokes at the expense of a protected group. And in that case, you're fine to run ads. So keep these questions coming. I'm more than happy to answer them. All right. That is it for this week's news flash. Make sure you like and subscribe. And I'll be back next week for another news flash from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators, it's been a pleasure.

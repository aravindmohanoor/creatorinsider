#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=0) |  Hello Insiders! This week I have a 

special guest I've got James who's working on some very important captions  planning. Welcome to the show James. Hey Tom thanks for having me. It''s good to have you back brother. Now today we're gonna talk about  Community Captions and what we're gonna kind of be a little more transparent  than we usually are around some of these types of projects because we're we're  taking a hard look on whether we should  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=30) |  sort of continue supporting them or not.

That's that's a pretty big decision so maybe can you give folks a little bit  of background on what is this feature why did we do it and you know why are  we why are we thinking about it now. Yeah absolutely so first kind of you  said before this is something this is a new experiment that we're trying here  we do here pretty often from Creators  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=60) |  that big decisions get made without  necessarily

Creators feeling like they have a chance to give input so we are  using this opportunity to take a step back and ask Creators what they think  about a decision before it gets made. And so we are starting to think about  whether or not we continue to have the Community Captions feature or whether  or not it makes sense to shut it down. Before I go into more detail about  that let me just kind of clarify a little bit what that means. So there are three ways that  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=90) |  most creators get captions or  subtitles. The

first that many of you are probably familiar with is  our automatic captions and those, for a number of languages, just  happen automatically on your video. Second many of you upload them  yourselves in some way, shape or form. And then the the last way is there's  a Community Captions feature where you can opt-in and allow anyone on the  Internet to come and suggest captions

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=120) |  for your video. And it's really  the

third one that we're wondering if it makes sense to continue or  if the effort that would be spent kind of building and maintaining it  would be spent on other features. Right and in fairness it's probably  we're leaning in the direction of of deprecating it and so this is a  very important conversation because we also know a lot of Creators  feel passionately about captions.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=150) |  This idea of anyone in the world 

can help you caption your video and then translate it and make  it kind of more accessible is an amazing vision. Like what what  do you think is driving our contemplation of why we wouldn't  continue support in that future? I couldn't agree more with  it without you framed it the reason that we're considering it  ultimately comes down to not that many Creators are ultimately using it. Just to be totally transparent it's less than one one thousandth of a percent  of channels have approved a community  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=180) |  caption track in the last month .

And so we actually went and started to talk with channels about why they  aren't using it, particularly ones that had used it in the past or were large  enough to have an audience for it. Some of the things that we heard were, "Well,  I really love that it exists," right everyone is positive on the theory and  then they said, "But..." They say things like, "But I've had problems with spam,"  or, "It's not reliable enough for me."  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=210) |  If we want to have the most

accessible  product possible for as many different people, we want creators to have the  widest possible audience for their videos this Community Captions feature  isn't accomplishing that goal. Even though it sounds really great in theory,  it only works for the biggest channels. And then there's problems with spam and  abuse and then people turn it off. And then consequently it's not on that  much watch time so only about 0.2% of watch time has a community caption  track on it. And so that's what has this leaning towards actually  shutting this this feature down.

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=240) |  I guess some people  may wonder like,

"Hey, well just leave it alone just leave  it as is." Like, why don't you just, you don't have to spend any more  time on it, like just let it be. Unfortunately that's that's  not the reality I think it is there's some pretty significant  costs to keeping it and I think we have a responsibility to make  sure that we're investing in the places that will have the most  kind return-on-investment here. I totally get where you're coming  from and I hope others who are  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=270) |  listening understand to like part of  the

reason for this video is to say, hey look if there's an angle  we haven't thought about, you know of course we're  gonna keep an open mind, but we we ultimately want to do the  best thing for the Creator ecosystem overall. But where are we going with  with the future of our captions roadmap? Yeah I'm glad you asked. So we  absolutely are not getting rid of the ability for a Creator to upload captions  or translations to their channel like that's not even in the consideration  set. There's a bunch of work that's  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=300) |  continuing to happen on automatic  captions, making

them more accurate, supporting more languages, making them  better, support punctuation and grammar, capitalization and stuff like  that. We're coming at this from wanting to have the most accessible  platform possible. It's really about how do we get there in a way  that's safe for the platform, safe for creators, and you know these  are, these are the hard questions. Yeah that's a great point about  the trade-offs because if you're  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=330) |  hearing this and you're like well I 

vote for keeping it what you're also voting for is less improvements  to the experience for Creators to upload their own captions, less  improvements on the automated captions, less improvements on the ability  to refine the automated captions. Setting aside this Community Caption  stuff when you think about where you'd like to see captions go forward  what what are some of the things

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=360) |  that you're kind of excited  for us

as a team to consider? We are working on a new captions  editor that I am really excited for. We actually have some creators out  there using an alpha version for the first time right now. I'm really  excited to see a tighter integration between what the Creator does and  auto captions and maybe the Creator, auto captions, and Google translate.  There's opportunities maybe to extend some of our Permission tools. Some  of the Creators I spoke to said,  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=390) |  "Well actually I don't use the project 

the product the way you intend. I have my three people that caption all my  videos and I only approve things that they write and I would much  rather just be able to send them an invite from permissions you  know to be able to kind of access only the captions and that would be a  better workflow for me and my team." With that said are there any  other questions that you have, James that you want to hear  from the audience that they can give us feedback on in terms  of how we're thinking about this?  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=420) |  Yeah, we would love it if people

would  weigh in here. The best type of feedback you can give us is information about why  and how it would affect your channel. If you don't think that we should do  this. One more thing, if I could I do want to just say we realize this  is a tough conversation and we thank you guys for having it with us  you know. James it just occurred to me that the other thing that we should mention is that this is a bit of a new format of an Insider  video. Like usually it's hey here's  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=450) |  some cool new stuff coming. This one 

is a little bit further upstream in the product development process and so  if you guys watching this have feedback on you know if you want to see this much  of the sausage-making like you know we could try and do more of it. I think  the risk is always like well you're never going to make everyone happy  and then people are gonna be pissed if you go in a different direction  I think we're taking a bet here that  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4&t=480) |  being more transparent and putting all  the

cards on the table might help us make a better decision based on the  input. Yeah this is brand-new first. time we've done something like this at least as far as I know. So make sure you subscribe to creator inside or if  you want to go behind the curtain and you can really get involved  in our product development. It's definitely inside baseball stuff, but hopefully some people find it helpful. All right you guys keep it real we'll  see you next time. Thanks James!

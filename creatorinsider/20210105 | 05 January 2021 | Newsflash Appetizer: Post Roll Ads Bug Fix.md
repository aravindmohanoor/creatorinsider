#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1IE5AjU8A&t=0) |  - What's up, Insiders? Happy New Year,

happy 2021. I hope that everyone had a safe and festive holiday, celebrating wherever you were. I'm Lauren, I'm a program manager on our creator team here at YouTube. And I'm also the producer of Creator Insider. Connor is out of the office this week and I wanted to hop on to make sure we didn't miss the first Newsflash of 2021. We have a short update for you this week. We actually only have one update

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1IE5AjU8A&t=30) |  but I wanted to also make sure

we didn't miss the movie quote from Tom's cameo last Newsflash. So let's hop into it. So the update this week is actually a bug fix, having to do with post-roll ads. And what that means is for monetizing creators, any video over 10 minutes in length will automatically have post-roll ads turned on by default. So creators can turn this post-roll ads off at any time if they'd like. They can do that during the upload flow

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1IE5AjU8A&t=60) |  by unchecking the box or post upload

in the Monetization tab. So let us know if you have any questions about that. I will make sure the comments get passed on to the team that works on it. And believe it or not, that's all we have for you this week. So moving on to the movie quote winner. The movie quote was actually from the series "Queens Gambit," and we had a lot of correct guesses but the first person to guess it correctly

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1IE5AjU8A&t=90) |  was The Moody Artist. So congratulations, The

Moody Artist. I'd be really curious to know if it was the quote or if it was the pose that gave away the series. I know I definitely laughed when I saw Tom's pose. So I hope you all enjoyed that. We definitely miss Tom on the channel. We'll try to get him back here as much as possible to say hi. But in the meantime, feel free to drop any comments  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1IE5AjU8A&t=120) |  or questions below and Connor will be

back next week. So we will see you then. Keep it real.

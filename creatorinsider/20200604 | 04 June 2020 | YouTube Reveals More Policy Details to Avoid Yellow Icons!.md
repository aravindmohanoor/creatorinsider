#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=0) |  hello insiders this is Todd back with

another update and bringing Connor from trust and safety team today to tell us more about an update to the Help Center related to self certification Connor what's been happening in the self certification world thanks Todd so some exciting things on our site and over the course of rolling iteself surged to everyone we've learned a ton about where creators can get tripped up by our policies as well as acknowledging ourselves that they can be very nuanced  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=30) |  and so today we want to talk

a bit about full resource for creators so that they can more easily navigate self-certification and get to know our policies more holistically as well so how did you approach this update where we started was really looking at the objective of self certification and I'm looking at this program which we've launched it's all about transparency and that's exactly what we want to bring to this helpful article as well so where we started was we looked at the internal

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=60) |  guidelines that we give our human review

team and we looked at what summary could we provide to the creator community surfacing key definitions that have long been asked for by creators for example how do you define nudity usually means a ton of different things to a ton of different people but this article really defines these key concepts and what they mean to YouTube so the creators can more accurately complete their questionnaire so which creators would you recommend check out this will help Center article  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=90) |  well ideally all creators anyone who wants

to know our policies better this is the first time that any content centered platform has been this transparent the questionnaire has eight sections but they're only ever going to be a summary of all of the policy guidance that YouTube maintains but if you're looking for who should definitely be reading this article it's gonna be especially helpful to creators with low accuracy I see so tell me more about creators who don't really see their

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=120) |  content being reflected in the questionnaire yeah

so when I said the questionnaire is only ever going to be a summary it's eight sections with short options to help guide creators to the right ratings now naturally that's not going to be the full detail of any of the policies each section represents and what we're really conscious of is that creators want to get it right and when they get it wrong there can be a huge impact and that impact is low  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=150) |  accuracy which means we trust your answers

an awful lot less so both in terms of accuracy and to ensure we're being transparent we're going all-in on transparency and really this is only going to be the beginning of the publication of these guidelines but we've quadrupled the word count we've introduced these new concepts and definitions so we're hoping it's going to be really helpful word count I thought you said we've quadrupled the word can't yes the Irish accent really

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=180) |  isn't it we've actually expanded the number

of words on the page so typically what we've heard from creators is we're never detailed enough detail at the extent that they need when they're trying to forecast what monetization rating they're going to get on their content so our drooping of the word count is a first step and we've introduced a lot more guidance are you including all the details of the policy in this update yes so that's really  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=210) |  important to call it we're not there

yet our policies are incredibly detailed so we're working to translate them into really neat sentences and we're planning on updating this article at least every two months if not more frequently great and if creators have feedback about this or questions what should they do well we're going to review all of the comments so if you've any thought that's good or bad leave a comment and we'll review it and who knows you might see your own bullet  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S47oAj0p9sQ&t=240) |  point represented in the next update to

this Help Center article great well thanks Connor for coming on and telling us more about the details were releasing around self-certified to be more transparent and please leave your feedback and otherwise keep it real I saw

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=0) |  hello insiders this week's newsflash first item

the option to use the classic upload flow will be removed over the next couple of weeks next week we'll remove the escape hatch for the first 1% and then 10% of users in early June as a reminder that new uploads flow has a lot of capabilities that the old one didn't have including for many YP p channels the ability to

we've also recently added the ability to do bulk uploads to the new uploads experience based on feedback during that earlier beta testing period if you have anything in the classic uploads flow that you think we missed that it's crucial let us know so far the feedback has been very positive and the error rates for uploads has come down dramatically since that new uploads flow is built on some improved technology

from our unlisted video review program take it away Conner everybody connor here from the youtube policy team excited to be back on creator insider to share some more insights with you so today we're going to be focusing on sexual content sometimes called adult content and and how it can exist on youtube so broadly speaking content that is intended to sexually arouse or to

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=120) |  sexually gratify doesn't belong on the platform

on the other end of the spectrum content that is educational maybe like sex ed or is in like a documentary context or is scientific or artistic and has both those intentions and the context to support them generally is allowable on the platform and in some cases can monetize however there is obviously a pretty big amount of gray area between  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=150) |  those two extremes and so I've pulled

out a couple of key areas that I'd like to talk through today to help clear up some of those top issues so let's start first with sex education videos these are suitable for the platform and are generally also suitable for monetization a couple things to look out for though are conversations of a very personal nature like your specific lived experiences with sex or sex tips and  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=180) |  those kinds of more graphic types of

conversations may not be suitable for advertising even if they are allowed on YouTube one of the questions that I would encourage you to ask yourself is is the primary impact of your video on viewers entertainment or education okay so moving on to topic number two what about nudity so censored or blurred nudity that is depicted briefly is generally okay for monetization when I  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=210) |  say briefly depicted I mean not focused

on similarly depictions of people wearing limited clothing but in kind of a context that it that you would expect that's reasonable so you know imagine someone wearing a bikini at the beach is also suitable for monetization I mentioned the word focused before and I should explain that a little bit more so if rests or butts or genitals are focused on and that could be using  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=240) |  zooming in or camera angles or compiling

multiple shots together to direct the viewers focus then that is generally not suitable for monetization on YouTube it's important to note that what I'm saying here about these types of depictions applies to both clothed and unclothed people and besides the impact on monetization these types of depictions also may be age restricted or

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=270) |  in certain cases not permitted on the

platform it's probably pretty obvious but full exposure nudity so like complete nudity is not suitable for monetization nor is it allowed on YouTube at all except in a couple very kind of specific cases like think classical art Michelangelo's David sculpture as an example lastly let's talk about actual sex acts so broadly  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=300) |  speaking depiction of sex acts is not

permitted on YouTube even when it's implied or it's animated or it's only in the audio educational documentary scientific or artistic intent and context might be factored into decisions made about depiction of sex acts but generally speaking that type of content would not be suitable for monetization and would likely be age restricted so  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=330) |  that's our set of insights for you

this week I hope these were valuable for you and I'll see you next time next we've routinely heard from subscribers that they would like additional features on the subs feed to help them catch up with their favorite creators based on this feedback we launched topics in the subscription speed on iOS in January to help subscribers browse the feed and catch up with their latest uploads topics in the subs feed is now available on Android as well next as part of our

new owners of a brand account within the first 7 days will no longer be able to remove admins undelete accounts or change to the primary owner lastly triviatime in the previous news flash I asked how would you know how many uploads to do in a given week if you are concerned about your current

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=390) |  viewers whether or not they were consuming

all of the content that you are putting up there what would be the metrics that you could look at to help inform that decision the first person to guess it correctly was ossified so congrats ossified and the answer was if you go to analytics so you go studio analytics audience there's a metric there called average views per viewer and so if you look at a 7-day period if your average  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=420) |  views for per viewer is let's say

1 and you're uploading every day it may still be a good strategy if you're trying to just get as much content and grow your audience as much as possible but if you're wondering Wow am I putting so much out there that my current viewers just like they can't they don't have enough time to consume all that content then the average views per viewer in a 7 day period could be a good indicator as  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=450) |  an example if you were doing let's

say once a week uploads and you were seeing that the average views per viewer was one or 0.7 you might think wow they're pretty much consuming everything I put out there maybe I should go twice a week and then if you go to you know two times a week and it's like 1.5 or 1.6 then you're like wow they keep taking more their sustained interest even though I'm uploading more frequently you know the opposite is true where if you're uploading daily and the average views  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=480) |  per viewer in a 7 day period

is only one you may want to kind of curtail that a little bit get a little bit of time for yourself or maybe think about those additional videos as mainly just acquiring brand-new users but your current audience doesn't yet have the appetite for that many videos so just something to keep in mind it's never a clean-cut answer I wish I could just tell you all there's a report that will tell you exactly how many videos to  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=510) |  upload you know per week but this

is a good indicator to help you think it through so for this week here is my trivia question there are a number of very easy one-time hacks that you can do to improve the growth of your memberships capability on your channel so if you've enabled memberships for your channel what are some things that you could do you only do it one time and it keeps helping you grow faster subsequently put it in the  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ5cSA9G2Y&t=540) |  comments below there's actually a few of

them but I'll just accept the first one and give you a shout-out at next week's news flash in the meantime keep it real

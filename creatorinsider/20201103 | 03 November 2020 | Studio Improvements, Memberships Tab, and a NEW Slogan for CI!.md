Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=0) |  - All right Insiders the channel is

"Creator Insider." The host is me, Conor and the update is Newsflash, your weekly update of everything that's launching in YouTube, changing in YouTube, improving on YouTube. So let's get into our updates. First up, we have private video sharing. Now what we have done, is we have replaced the deep link to classic studio, private video sharing with a native studio link.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=30) |  So what this means is creators can

share their video privately with specific email addresses. Now, although there has been no functionality added, this means that you creators no longer get redirected to the caustic studio interface, more good news, we're editing, or rather we're transferring the ability to edit the title and the description language into the upload flow within studio.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=60) |  Now what this is, is part of

a campaign to make sure that our new studio interface is as intuitive as possible. Right? Next up, we have some exciting news about the memberships tab. That's right. The membership's team has redesigned that tab for existing members to your channel. And what we're hoping this does is make it more convenient and accessible for your members to see and engage with members only posts

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=90) |  members only videos and members only live

streams. Now, when is this all going to happen? Well, the train has left the station this week more and more of your members will see this new experience. We're not rolling it out a 100 %, so we're not rolling it out to all members of every members, only channel or feed or series of posts. What we're doing is we're starting bit by bit before we move on to what you've all been waiting for, which is the answer and the winner to last week's trivia  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=120) |  question, let's stay with memberships for a

little while. Why is this change to the memberships top significant? Well, as most of you know, what you had to do was create a members only post in order for a members only video to be available to those members. Now, what members can do is access those videos through the members tab or the membership's tab rather, irrespective of whether you've created a post. Now we're offering a suggestion as a best practice,  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=150) |  a bit of advice, keep on creating

those posts. Irrespective of the fact that members can still access the members only video, through the memberships tab, why to ensure that they get the notifications that you've actually created, that members only video and that they can gain value from the membership they're signed up for to your channel. Before I move on, I know you're are probably thinking Conor you're spending way too much time on memberships, but want to make sure that we resolve any element that could

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=180) |  be confusing before you become confused. The

membership's update that I've just given you is relevant only to those members only videos. There is absolutely no change to any of the settings. Any of the availability, any of the accessibility, your subscribers, or non-subscribers may have to a public video. We're all clear on that. Awesome. Let's move on to trivia. We asked last week,  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=210) |  what should the slogan of the channel

be? And this is part of our campaign to increase our subscribers by 10,000 before the end of the year. Now, if you haven't been watching consistently firstly, shame on you. But what I had said a couple of weeks ago, just to refresh your memory is that we want to set ourselves a target of growing the subscriber, kind of this channel by 10,000 subscribers before the end of the year. Now, at that point we were at 359,000 subscribers.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=240) |  We're now at 364. That means that

we're almost at that halfway Mark. So what we want to do is hear more suggestions from you. But some of the suggestions we want you to solicit were in how can we better market this channel? Because what we hear is there are a lot of really useful updates. There's an awful lot of opportunity to contribute feedback to new changes that are happening on the platform.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=270) |  But people don't actually know that everybody

who appears on this channel, aside from the guest creators are actually YouTube employees. So you're hearing directly from the teams that work on the features and products that directly impact not only your experience as a content creator, but your audience experience as well. So what we had done was asked last week, what should our slogan be? And Kasturi Roy came up with a great slogan, which we are going to be adopting,

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=300) |  which is from the creators of YouTube

to YouTube creators. Next I hear you ask in terms of the trivia question, well, we're going to be departing from our standard trivia questions just for a little while longer, because what we're seeing in terms of the feedback through comments is really, really valuable. So we're going to change our target from reaching 10,000 more subscribers from 359,000 to 20,000 new subscribers  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=330) |  by the end of the year. And

here's where we need your help. And this is the question for next week. If you could have a guest on the channel from any team at YouTube, if you could get one of those teams together and ask one question that has always been bugging you, what would that be? And What would the team be? Now that might be a little bit overwhelming in terms of challenge. So think of it another way what is one thing that you've always wanted to understand  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=360) |  about the platform might be really old.

It might be something that's just come up this year or this week that you would just love an answer to that you think other people would love to know as well. And also give us some feedback on if you're liking this new direction of how we can grow the channel together. And If you're not, we can always revert back to the concept trivia questions. All right. That is it from me. Thank you so much for the feedback that we've gotten over the past couple of weeks, we got some really great comments,and keep them coming.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzcMvbFUhmE&t=390) |  And if you have any questions on

anything that we have run through today, make sure that you put them in the comments below. So signing off from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators, this has been "Creator Insider". I've been your host Conor stay safe this week and we'll sync next week.

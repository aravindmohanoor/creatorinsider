Insider's weekly newsflash. And guess what I have for you. Updates, let's get right into them. Now, this is an update about terms of service. If you're an avid watcher of Creator Insider, you'll remember that in November of last year, we updated you that the US YouTube terms of service would be changing.

easy to scan, and easy to navigate. Let's talk improvements.

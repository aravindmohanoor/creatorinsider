#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=0) |  hello insiders new slash time this will

be a quick one first item the YouTube audio library is moving to the new studio so we've always had a deep link to the classic version of the audio library but now we have a completely new native version built on the latest youtube studio technology so you're gonna have all of the youtube audio library tracks from classic studio available natively but we've also made a lot of changes to the interface the  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=30) |  audio library with studio patterns and added

new features to aid search and discovery of royalty free music for creators to use in your videos so check it out let us know what you think in the comments below so you guys I remember I promised you that all those deep link things to classic will start showing up natively and we are just powering through the last few next we are bringing dark Moe to 100% of iOS Studio

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=60) |  mobile app users by mid-may maybe earlier

the rollout has already started very gradually next several weeks ago we came to you for feedback about the potential deprecation of community captions James and I have been going through all of the comments on that video and we're having a number of internal meetings to discuss what we can learn from them so stay tuned we'll share more information on that soon today I also want to get your input on  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=90) |  another feature which is the poll cards

the info cards that have the polls we are considering retiring these and want to get feedback from the community the main reason is like most of our deprecations its lack of usage less than 0.2 percent of channels have used them at all this year and additionally most of the channels that are getting real engagement on them have a better option so because of this we think that the

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=120) |  info card polls are probably a good

candidate for deprecation which then frees up resources to work on other features such as improving the do-it-yourself captions and proving the dashboard dark mode on desktop so there's a lot of things that we want to do to improve the Creator experience obviously we can't work on everything so over time you have to continuously prune those features that we know creators are not using as much  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=150) |  as others so this will not change

anything for other info card types like you know video links or playlist links or web links and it does not change anything about n screens but for info card polls we're thinking of moving them off and focusing efforts on higher benefiting creator features so let us know in the comments below if those are crucial to you and maybe even more  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=180) |  important what are some other things that

you'd like us to improve in YouTube studio because we might have a little bit of extra bandwidth if we can move off of poll carts so curious to hear what you think next for trivia last week I asked you what was a key feature that we have launched in Android creator studio mobile app and the answer was dark mode which I know a lot of you are digging which is why we're working hard to make it available on iOS as well and

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=210) |  the first person who guessed that it

was the Android dark mode was overlord actual so congrats overlord actual you got there first okay this week I have a question for you mm-hmm this week's trivia question if you want to get a sense of the size of your audience the size and reach of your channel what is the best way to do that and I'm gonna give you a hint the subscriber count is  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=240) |  often referred to by many people when

they say oh yeah you know I have a youtube channel has this many subscribers or wow that channel has as many subscribers it often times is not exactly the best way to gauge the reach of a channel so I'm curious what you think would be the best way and there's two potential answers so maybe we'll call out two winners unless one person gets both of them first first question will be let's say  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrpvnzdy6qU&t=270) |  you don't have access to that channels

YouTube analytics you just see what you see as a viewer how would you assess that channels audience the size of the audience and two is for your own channel where you do have access at YouTube analytics what's the best way to assess the size of your typical audience so with that I will see what you guys say in the comments and see you next week

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=0) |  hello insiders this is Todd and we're

back with some more information for creators today we're gonna be talking about branded content and I've invited Henry here Henry you want to introduce yourself hey how's it going I'm Henry I'm a product manager here on famebit which is YouTube's tier house branded content platform so what's been going on with branded content on YouTube cool so firstly I think branded content on YouTube is you know it's huge so what we're trying to do in the branded content industry is going to facilitate  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=30) |  those connections and it's really important for

creators you know drives a lot of revenue into the ecosystem so the crater's confirm that content and it's really important for brands so they can find an audience for their products it's not without some challenges it's tough if you're a creator it can be hard to find you now once you've found a deal it's hard to know how to price yourself it's hard to know how much creative freedom you can have with your content and as an advertiser it's hard to measure the impact of your campaign you're beyond reviews there's not only love data available so what we're trying to enflame it is try and solve a few of those problems so how has Fame been helping creators  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=60) |  and advertisers solve these problems yeah sure

so I think we think about it in a couple of different ways so what we're really trying to do is bring the best of Google and YouTube technology to the branded content industry we think of this in products in three different groups so you have things for creators for advertisers and obviously for viewers so as rank greater insider let's jump into the creator side so a lot of companies in this space have small rosters of creators and we're really proud of what we're trying to do in  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=90) |  democratizing access to branded content so we'll

actually pitch any crater in the whole ecosystem we think they're a great fit for a brand's campaign we can pitch them and so when a brand comes to us and they want to run a campaign we're not just looking okay is this channel a good fit to the brand and obviously that's important we're actually trying to look through to the audience of that channel and we want to line it up to the you know the group that the brand is from a cell to is the same group that's watching the audience that these creators and that gives us the power to curate any creatives on YouTube rather  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=120) |  than having to depict stick to a

you know smaller roster and it also means that the you know the content is gonna land better with the audience who are actually interested in the product that's being talked about we're also building tools to try and broaden access to as many craters as possible we launched something recently for an onboarding flow so if you go to new studio you'll see a favorite tab in the monetization hub and if you're an illogical creator in a few clicks you can get signed up you can become a favorite creator so there are a couple things you've been doing for creators so how about for brands what's what's new

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=150) |  for brands with fame beer and why

why would a brand even want to use Fame bed as opposed to just going directly to creators so the biggest reason that we see is that historically in branded content there's been very little measurement available so if you're a brand and you work with some craters for an agency directly and MCM whatever there's often not a lot of data available to know how did that video perform and that really contrasts with other digital ad formats if you might pretty much any other digital ad format you're going to know how to form tiny  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=180) |  people collected how many people went and

purchased and in branded content is just not the case so what we're doing at famebit is trying to bring all of the ads measurement tools that Google and YouTube have made over the last 10 15 years and apply them to branded contents the first time and this relates brands measured the ROI of their campaigns so they know actually how did it impact the audience and they often these videos perform really well and so it's very powerful to show brands this positive performance so they haven't been able to see before and then it makes them want to come back you know spend more money  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=210) |  in the ecosystem drive more revenue to

creators so how we're specifically doing that is some is a couple of tools one is what we call brand influence live which measures increased searches from people who watch the videos another uses the surveys you often see across YouTube and so that's less what we call influencer lift as if you watch the video and you know you answer this surveys with higher awareness or perception of the brand it's again another positive signal and we have organic view-through conversions as well and so that lets you as an advertiser see how many people actually checked out  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=240) |  your website or even bought your product

and they were really important so that you know you know what was the performance of this campaign and did it change people's behavior or not so you mentioned their viewers were also a key aspect of branded content so you tell us a little bit about what viewers might notice about I think the biggest thing is we're trying to build new formats so the viewing experience this branded content is kind of as powerful as it can be so what you might have seen in the wire is branded content videos from famous  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=270) |  that have a shelf below the player

and that shuffled feature products and the crater's talking about so you'll be there in the craters talking about some product on this shelf you be able to see the product with a price and a retailer and it's easy to click through and check it out they're the same thing for apps and my favorite is this augmented reality Beauty Tryon shelf so this is where you're watching a beauty video you can click a Tryon button and with permission it will open your front facing camera you can try on the lipstick or the master or whatever it is and check out the color and see if it's a good fit for your face or not so tell me about the different service

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=300) |  models that famebit uses so famebit has

two service models that we've run so we have the self service platform which is what came through the acquisition of famebit several years ago that's at famebit.com and that's where brands and craters work directly with each other without much involvement from youtube we also have failed at full service and so that's a fully managed experience where brands and creators we you know we do the project management we coordinate everything find the craters and this is where all those technologies that I mentioned are kind of coming to life at  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=330) |  the moment the total power toked each

creator from full services have 30 times the size for self service business so the self service platform is not performing so well and that's because famous South survey came to this acquisition so it's built in a different technical staff and I means all of these technologies and tools that we've made they can't integrate with it it's kind of on its own doesn't connect to YouTube and so without all of these technologies and just kind of with a different model it hasn't performed as well over the years and creators have flocked over to  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=360) |  full service and brands have flocked over

to full service while self service hasn't flourished so much and at the moment only 4% of famebit pounds come from the self-service platform so 96% of creator earnings come from full serve and so for that reason this week we're announcing that we're going to be deprecating the famebit self sales platform and shutting it down so that we can focus our efforts on making full service as successful as it can be can you tell us a little bit about like what what this means for creators yeah of course so I think the first thing to mention  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=390) |  is that we're going to be phasing

a shutdown over several months so we reduce any impact on going campaigns so how this is gonna work is that now as we announced just a couple of days ago we've already blocked new signups so it's only existing users with brands and craters who can log in so in a couple of weeks we're going to be blocking brands from posting new campaigns and a couple of weeks after that we're going to be blocking creators from submitting proposals to those campaigns so that point is only existing campaigns only  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=420) |  pre hired creators and then we're going

to wait two months but all those campaigns to finish and close out now that point will fully block login to the platform if you want to see the full timeline for this with the specific details and dates you can click the the Help Center article which is going to be in the description we want to help make this is you know have as little impact on creators as possible and so to reduce that impact we're going to making a one-time payment to every creator who's earned any money on the platform in the three months prior to this this sunsetting announcement so if you  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=450) |  completed one campaign for a hundred dollars

in that three month window we're gonna match that hundred dollars with another hundred dollar payments if you completed three campaigns each for $200 let's say you already earned six hundred dollars and they're going to making a payment for another six hundred dollars trying to do some of this impact to you so if I'm a creator who's only ever used this self-service option and I've never used the full service am I going to be eligible to use the full service are there any any special criteria for that yeah so it's a great question so there are different eligibility requirements  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=480) |  and you the easiest way to find

out is to go to new YouTube studio looketh famebit as a tab in the monetization hub and if it's there and you can sign up then that means you're eligible the biggest change is probably the the sub requirement is twenty-five thousand subscribers for full service business so it is a little bit higher than the self service platform there's also people could use the self-service platform without having YouTube accounts and now we're using full service everyone needs to have a youtube account because we primarily go through YouTube so there  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=510) |  are a couple of changes when we

understand there's challenging for some craters and that's why we want to reduce the impact by having these payments so anyone who made you know any revenue in the last three months is gonna be getting this additional payment to try and reduce some of them got it so can you tell us some stories maybe about some creators that are really having success through using the platform these days yeah of course so some craters who've had a lot of success on a full-service business I guess a couple might  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=540) |  favorites one was the the Hershey's hot

cocoa kisses campaign and I think it really nicely highlighted the power of new creative freedom that you can give to a creator so this was a campaign specifically with her she's an appraiser the icing artist I should have a baking challenge and made that the most incredible cake I've ever seen so we'll definitely check that one out another is was a Calvin Klein campaign and it was great as Shalem black I'm Tara Kelly and they spoke about really personal powerful issues I think they  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=570) |  want a Streamy award for the videos

I think it really shows the power the branded contact can have if I'm a creator and I want to learn more about Fame bid maybe get started with it what should we do yes so the UM the biggest thing is go to youtube studio check out that fame bit tab and get yourself signed up it's a really lightweight onboarding flow and I guess you contracted and it makes it really easy for us to include you in Fame that campaigns in the future does that mean the biggest thing I might also suggest you check out the fame bet Help Center  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVHxv2lQl-I&t=600) |  article if you want to understand any

more about the the self-service platform and the Sun sensing of what that means for you and your channel and finally there's a lot more to come this if please watch the space I work on a lot of new stuff and hopefully back on on insider said great well thanks for all that information so if you're interested in famebit check out the links below and we'll catch you next time until then keep it real thank you

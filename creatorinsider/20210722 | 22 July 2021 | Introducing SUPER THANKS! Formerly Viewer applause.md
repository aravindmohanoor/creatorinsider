Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=0) |  (swooshing) - Hey Insiders, welcome to "Creator

Insider." My name is Abhinav, and I'm a program manager here at YouTube. Today we have with us Shereen, who's going to tell us a little more about an exciting feature launch. Shereen, what team do you work on? - Hey, Insiders, I'm Shereen. I'm on YouTube's Product Solutions Team working on our Supers products. I'm excited to be here today to talk to you about a new product that we're expanding to more creators. - Thank you so much for that intro.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=30) |  What are you here to talk with

us about today? - Well, as you know, we're always looking for new ways to help creators diversify their revenue and better engage with their communities and fans. Today, I'm really happy to share that we're beginning to expand Super Thanks. It's a new way for fans to show support to their favorite creators directly on video watch pages. You may have seen some of our earlier tests with this product called Viewer Applause. It's the same feature, just with a new name. Similar to how viewers currently can use Super Chat  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=60) |  to support their favorite live streamers, with

Super thanks, fans can now do the same thing, but on their video uploads. Viewers can buy a fun animation on a video's watch page. And as an added bonus, purchasers will get a distinct, colorful comment in the video's comment section that lets them stand out and be recognized by their favorite creators. - This is so exciting. I'm pretty sure all the creators who are watching this right now

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=90) |  are also feeling super excited about this

launch. We have also seen some comments on the channel about this feature, so I'm really glad that you are here to tell us a little more about it, but how did this feature really come about? - Well, since launching Super Chat in 2017 and Super Stickers in 2019, creators from around the world have told us that they want us to bring this magic beyond just live streams and premiers and to video uploads. And that's exactly what we've done with Super Thanks.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=120) |  - That's great. So who has access

to it? And can you give us a quick demo of the feature? - Sure. First off, Super Thanks is available in 68 locations and can be purchased on iOS, Android, and web. There are four different types of animations that you can purchase at four price points. The more you pay, the more elaborate the Super Thanks animation. The one-time animation will be shown to the purchaser over the top of the channel's video.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=150) |  And as an added bonus, purchasers will

get a distinct, colorful comment that says, "Thanks" in the videos comment section. This is a great way for fans to stand out and be recognized. - Very cool. And who has access to this feature? - Just this week, we started expanding the beta to thousands of monetizing creators across 68 locations. We're still testing things out and working with creators to gather feedback, so the feature is not available to everyone just yet.

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=180) |  But fear not, we're expanding availability to

eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program later this year. Here's how you can check to see if you have access to the feature. First sign into YouTube Studio. In the left menu, click Monetization, then select the Supers tab. If it's your first time in the Super section, follow the onscreen instructions to get started. Heads-up that you have to be monetizing and in an eligible location to have access  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=210) |  to the Supers tab. If you see

Super Thanks with an on/off button next to it at the top right hand of the page, you have access. If you don't see Super Thanks, you don't currently have access. When you turn Super Thanks on, the Thanks button will appear on all eligible videos automatically. When you turn it off, it removes the button from all of your videos. The help center articles linked in the description below will have more details about availability and video eligibility. So be sure to check them out.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=240) |  - Is there anything else that our

creators should know about this feature? - I just wanted to add a few more things about Super Thanks. One of the great things about this product is connecting with fans who have purchased. You can see who has made a Super Thanks purchase in the comments section of YouTube Studio by filtering for Super Thanks comments. There, you can review, reply, heart, or even remove Super Thanks comments from your videos. We definitely recommend replying or hearting those comments

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=270) |  to show your purchasers your gratitude. You

can see your total and per video Super Thanks earnings in YouTube analytics revenue report. Super Thanks revenue share is the same as Super Chat, Super Stickers and channel memberships. And although you can't request access to Super Thanks right now, you'll receive a notification in your studio dashboard once you do have access. - Is all so awesome. Do you think there are any best practices that our creators should be following  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=300) |  while using Super Thanks? - My top

tip is to engage and celebrate. Whether you thank your fans with a video, a credit role, a community post, or you heart or reply to those comments, fans are really excited to connect with you and be recognized for their purchase. And a quick shout-out makes them feel like valuable contributors to your channel. Also, don't forget to let them know how to make the Super Thanks purchase. Since the product is new, not everyone will know.  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=330) |  - Nice. I know I've been asking

you a bunch of questions on behalf of our "Creator Insider" audience. Is there anything that you would like to ask our "Creator Insider" audience? - We would love your feedback as we grow this product. So please let us know what you think in the comment section below. - Well, I guess that's the end of this episode and thank you so much Shereen for taking out time and coming on the show. We really look forward to this feature rolling out to more and more creators,  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtRNbRKiVk&t=360) |  and we'd be happy to have you

back on the show to provide more updates when you have any enhancements done to Super Thanks. - It's been great to be here. Bye everyone.

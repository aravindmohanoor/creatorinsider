Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=0) |  - All right, Insiders. The date is

Tuesday, 27th of October. The host is me, Connor, the channel is "Creator Insider," and, unlike other weeks, what we're gonna do today is start with some questions from you. What I've been bowled over by over the past couple of months is the extent to which people engage through comments. Of course, we know that comments are a huge part of the YouTube ecosystem, but it's not simply about feedback. What we've been seeing is a ton of questions coming through  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=30) |  that are very specific to different parts

of the YouTube ecosystem. So what we're gonna try and do today is just take a couple of those and provide direct answers from the teams themselves, delivered through me, your host. We hope you enjoy a couple of these. So let's get into it. All right, our first question, let's read it out. Eric Rosen writes, "What is the best resolution for a vertical, short video?  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=60) |  "Also, if someone views a short on

desktop, "does it still play vertically?" So, Eric, really good question. There's not resolution that we can recommend at the moment. Resolution is a function of a number of different factors, for example, internet quality and phone type. When it comes to somebody viewing a vertical, short video on desktop, it's gonna be the same experience as you have now. And what that means is you're gonna see those black bars

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=90) |  at either side of the video as

the viewer's watching it. Gominuke asks, "Is there any way to upload a short "without it appearing in your YouTube channel?" Unfortunately, not at the moment. There are a couple of experiments in the works, so, keep on watching the channel, and we'll let you know if that becomes possible. Carson Jay writes, "How much does SEO matter with shorts? "Should we still try to include tags in the title and description?"  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=120) |  Well, Carson, you don't have to include

tags, but if you do include hashtag shorts in your video's title, it'll mean that it has more of a chance to appear where shorts appear on the platform. When it comes to using that short's hashtag, it'll actually appear both in the title and on the short's shelf. So in the title as the viewer is watching it and in the short's shelf as a viewer is browsing  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=150) |  which one of your fabulous shorts to

view. Tube Relevant writes, damn, that is a good channel name. Tube Relevant writes, "I don't want the shorts to appear" "on my channel's video page. "So, if I make the shorts video unlisted, "would it be discoverable?" And the simple answer there is, if you make a video unlisted, it's not gonna be discoverable at all, unless you send that link to someone else. Next up, we have some really exciting news

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=180) |  about how you can best customize your

channel. So, as we've talked about before, you can customize your channel in YouTube Studio under a section called Customization. "What's new," I hear you ask. Well, folks, what you're gonna be able to do is add a section for your short videos and place that wherever you want on your channel. Couple of things to note. To actually find this, you're gonna go into add section under featured sections and you're gonna see short videos.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=210) |  And what you're gonna do there is

be able to move it around just like you are in any other part of your channel that you wanna feature. One thing to note though, is it's only gonna appear for users who are looking at your channel via the mobile app. As ever, gives us much feedback as you possibly can in the comments, we'll feed that back to the product team and we'll see if we can't make it even better on the basis of your feedback. All right, now we're back to the suggestions that you, the Creator Insider viewers and subscribers  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=240) |  had made to us to make this

channel better and more relevant to you, the viewers. So we're taking on one of those suggestions this week and we're gonna continue it for the next couple of weeks and see how it goes. This is from Molly's artistry. And what Molly had suggested was, that we would allow Creator Insider viewers and subscribers to submit videos to us with questions. And what we'll try and do, myself and Lauren, the fantastic program manager

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=270) |  that manages this channel. You've seen her

in many of the videos already. Is we will take it on to find the right team within YouTube to answer that question. We'll either get the question written down from them or they'll come on the channel. And now you'll see me reaching for my glasses because I've forgotten what the email address is, which you will see in the description below. And that is ci-video-submissions@google.com. Lauren also included a note  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=300) |  to please limit your questions, to one

per video and under 30 seconds. You can also see that we've updated our Thursday videos with a bright new thumbnail. So we're experimenting again with those suggestions, with a view, to growing this channel by 10,000 subscribers before the end of the year. Now, two things, trivia, what was the question last week? YouTube pranked the users of its homepage a couple of years ago, and redirected all of the videos that were featured on the homepage  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=330) |  to which music video. And that was

Rick Astley's infamous video, which spurred the term being Rick rolled. And the winner, bump, bump, bump, bum, NickPixelTV. So thanks so much NickPixelTV for answering that. And the next question that we're gonna ask is what should the new tagline of the Creator Insider channel be? We want to see those suggestions in the comments  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=360) |  we're gonna pick one, it's gonna become

part of the channels marketing and it's branding. And the reason why I'm asking this question as opposed to a trivia question is, we got feedback around, the fact that people didn't actually know that this was run by YouTube employees. And it was run specifically for you, the viewer, the user of the platform. So that you could benefit from all of these informal updates. So that's why we really want you to help us.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0wAVxikSY&t=390) |  Let us know what you think in

the comments below and I will see you next week.

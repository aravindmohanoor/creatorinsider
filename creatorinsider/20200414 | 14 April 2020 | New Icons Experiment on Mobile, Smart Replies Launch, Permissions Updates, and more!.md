Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMZqxczIP3I&t=60) |  that doesn't make it easy enough for

you if you want comment management to be even easier we now have smart replies for comments available to all English speaking channels we've talked about smart replies on the show before but if you missed it smart replies are like suggestions that help you respond quickly and easily to your audience and just like Gmail smart replies they're editable so you know you can kind of start with something but maybe personalize it just a little bit the  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMZqxczIP3I&t=90) |  team is looking at expanding to more

languages in the future okay quick update on hijacking prevention we know that channel hijacking is a big topic right now this is something that's getting a lot of effort internally one small but I think good update on this starting on April 6 users are gonna be forced to reenter Kate before they do channel transfer or an Adsense Association change this is a small change but you know everything helps here we definitely want to keep your channels safe one more experiment

iOS mobile so for about 5% of iOS users will have different icons to try to help improve accessibility by featuring the outlined assets for non selected options and filled icons for the selected icons this allows for a high contrast and consistent State for selected and unselected icons yeah that's all we got this week if you'd like to share today definitely let us know in the comments

We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=0) |  - What's up Insiders, Lauren here. I'm

the program manager on our creator team and I'm also the producer of Creator Insider. So today we have a quick newsflash for you, and then I'm gonna hand it over to Nick, a product manager on our comments team, who's gonna talk a little bit more about the features they've been launching recently, what you can expect from comments in the future and generally how they're thinking about comments on the platform. So let's hop into the first update. The update this week is a small launch on Android  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=30) |  where creators will now be able to

see their video restrictions in the Studio Mobile app. So we wanna make sure that even if you're on the go, you know if there's anything preventing your videos from distribution or monetization. Now within the video list on the Studio Mobile app, there will be colored icons indicating copyright strikes, community guidelines strikes, suitability warnings, et cetera. And you'll be able to click on the individual icon

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=60) |  to learn more about that specific restriction.

In the future will bring the ability to review and resolve all video restrictions within the Studio Mobile app, but for now you can review and resolve community guidelines strikes only for everything else you'll wanna go to desktop. Let us know if you have any feedback in the comments below, and with that, I will pass the torch over to Nick. - Hello Insiders, I'm Nick, a product manager on Comments.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=90) |  We know that comments are key to

every interaction between viewers and creators on YouTube. Today, I wanted to talk to you about how we're thinking about comments and what's in store for the future. We know the way that people interact with comments is always evolving and can affect your experience on YouTube both as a viewer and a creator. So let's talk about how our philosophy has evolved as we've introduced more features and brought more creators onto the platform. Over the last few years, we've increased investment dramatically in the comment space  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=120) |  and we've really doubled down on protecting

creators. Our focus is really about making sure that creators aren't exposed to inappropriate or hurtful comments, and instead, are able to spend their time on the things that matter, like answering questions from their audience. We're also investing quite a bit in new tools to help creators set the tone of conversation in their community because we know that no two channels on YouTube are the same. One of the recent features that we've built in this space is Civility Reminders, which we talked about in a previous newsflash.

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=150) |  But for those of you that have

forgotten, Civility Reminders is a feature on Android, available to the United States, that reminds viewers to keep things civil when they're about to leave a comment that might be otherwise inappropriate. The commenter can still post the comment as is but civility reminders gives the commenter a chance to reflect on their comment before they post it and edit that comment. Another feature that recently shipped was Merged Moderation tabs. What that did was take the likely spam tab  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=180) |  and the Held for Review tab and

merge it into a single experience. We hope that with this feature, creators will be much more efficient in moderation, having only one tab to look at instead of two. And last, but certainly not least, is comment expiration. In the past, comments would pile up in the Held for Review queue indefinitely. We fixed that recently by making it so that comments only remain in the Held for Review queue for 60 days. We believe that this will save creators a considerable amount of time

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=210) |  and reduce the odds that they're exposed

to spammy or negative old comments. So you're probably wondering how will this impact my channel's performance? We've designed all of these features in the Held for Review queue such that it has no impact on your channels performance. In fact, we recommend that creators feel free to ignore that tab entirely. Don't feel like you have to engage with it, don't feel like you have to approve comments. We've also been thinking about how we can work toward our goals on a platform level.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=240) |  Over the last two years, we've invested

significantly in new automated detection technology that helps us more effectively remove hateful and harassing comments on the platform. The impacts of this technology have been quite profound. Since 2019, we've increased the amount of comments we take down on a daily basis due to hate speech by 46X. And if a channel repeatedly violates the community guidelines of YouTube, we will take action and terminate the account, which they have the ability to appeal if they need to.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=270) |  We're also focused on providing more tools

to creators and creator studio that enable them to better protect themselves. Creator Insider will be the first to know when new features are on the way, and we can't wait to hear your feedback or any other feature ideas. As an early preview, we're looking at providing tools to creators to help them better establish the tone of their channel, like channel rules or guidelines. We'd love to hear your feedback. Please leave it down below, along with any questions,  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMcS0WRVCo&t=300) |  and let us know what you'd like

to see from the comments space in the future. So from Milton and I, keep it real.

Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=0) |  - Hello insiders. So glad to see

all the likes and comments on the newsflash. Thank you so much for the feedback and we'll try to incorporate some of that in this video. Lets get started with this week's newsflash. First update: using automated systems to identify content made for 18 and over viewers on YouTube. This update applies for creators making content meant for an 18 and older audience on YouTube. While there are no major age restriction policy changes beginning today and rolling over the next few months.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=30) |  We will expand the use of our

automated system to identify and apply age restrictions to videos that aren't appropriate for viewers under 18. Why are we doing this? These changes are in line with the upcoming recreations in the AU. Which are focused on insuring platforms, like YouTube verify users age. If they want to watch context appropriate for people over 18. So what does that actually mean for my channel? Viewership on videos made for audience over the age of 18 will likely be reduced, as they won't be seen

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=60) |  by viewers who are logged out under

18 or watching embeds from moster party sites. There should only be slight reduction to monetization on these videos because they will already have limited or no ads. As always creators can appeal an age restriction if they think there was an error. If you want more details on this, our creator liaison Matt Coval, covers this in the video we'll leave in the description below. Make sure to check it out. Next update. How to make money on YouTube 101.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=90) |  A very exciting topic. Based on the

comments. Connor recorded a session all about how to make money on YouTube. Both through advertising and alternative monetization products. We'll leave it in the description if you want to check it our. Next update. Mic reading set official series to new studio. A while ago we mentioned a few playlist features that due to low usage we were not going to pull over from classic studio to new studio.

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=120) |  If you want a refresher, we'll have

that video linked below. A quick update, we've heard your feedback on the set official series feature and we'll be migrating that over to the new studio. Thank you so much for that feedback. Next update. Channel customization roll out. Earlier this year we told you that we'll soon have the ability to customize your channel directly within YouTube studio. You'll be able to edit your channel's homepage layout to feature your most important content and update your profile image, channel name,  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=150) |  and channel banner to match your brand.

We're happy to announce that we're starting to release the new channel customization features to YouTube Studio users all over the world. If you don't see it yet, no need to be alarmed. Over the course of the next month or so you should start seeing the new options in the left hand navigation of your studio. We're aiming for 50% launch to creators this week. So how do I know I have this new experience? On your YouTube.com, on your on channel page  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=180) |  when you click on the customization channel

button, you will be redirected to the new experience in Studio. Or when you're in YouTube Studio you will notice a new customization option in the left navigation. Were very excited to bring channel customization into Studio. Making your YouTube Studio truly a one destination for creators. Happy customizing. Next update. Were beginning a 1% experiment merging the two comment moderation tabs. Likely spam, comments can now be found

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=210) |  at the bottom of the "held for

review" tab. We hope that the new combined "held for review" tab will help simplify your moderation experience and reduce the amount of work for creators. Were continuing the work on ways to improve your moderation experience and increase efficiency. Next update. Copyright tab expansion in Studio. Were expanding access to the Copyright tab to all YouTube Studio users. You will be able to one: see detailed history  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=240) |  of your previously submitted Copyright take down

requests. Two: quickly access the Copyright complaint web form to report any videos that use your Copyright protected work without permission. You can find the Copyright tab on the left-hand side of the studio interface. And that's a wrap for this week's newsflash. Last week's trivia question was: What is the most viewed YouTube original film? The answer is "The Thinning." and our winner is BuddyYT. Congratulations.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQxQ-ssCZjg&t=270) |  This week's trivia question is going to

be an inspiration from Tom's "This week's movie." Are you ready? Here's the quote. See if I can't trust you Ray, then I don't have no choice but to put you outside the circle and once your out, your out, and there's no coming back." First person to guess correctly in the comments will get a shout out in the next newsflash. Stay safe. Keep it real, your host Maria.

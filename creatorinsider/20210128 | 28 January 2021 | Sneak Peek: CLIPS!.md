Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=0) |  - Hello Insiders, my name is Chris.

And I'm an engineer on YouTube Gaming. And today, I'm here with my teammate, Saladin. And we're gonna show you something that we're about to start testing called Clips. So Sal, you wanna introduce yourself? - Yes, thanks Chris. I'm really excited to be on the Creator Insider channel today. Hi, Saladin. I'm a product manager on the YouTube Gaming team and I work with Chris. - I'm really excited to share what we've been working on. So tell us about Clips. - Sure, a few years ago, we started getting  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=30) |  a lot of requests from our gaming

creators and viewers. They wanted to have a way for viewers to highlight fun and interesting moments on live streams in particular. We spent a lot of time thinking about how to best integrate this feature into YouTube. Because YouTube is the home not just for live streams, but also for a massive library of all the VODs that you all have uploaded. We knew that we can make something really special that could address both these VODs as well as live streams. So today, I'm happy to share with you Clips.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=60) |  A fun way for people to share

part of a video with their own attribution. - That sounds great, but we all wanna know a little bit more. So what exactly is a clip? - So up until now, videos can be shared using the Watch Page URL. You could also potentially add a parameter to set the start time if you wanna say, "Oh, I wanna start halfway through the video," or "I wanna start one minute into the video." And that's great and all, but with Clips you can actually select between 5 and 60 seconds of that video or that live stream.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=90) |  And it generates its own unique clip

URL. This particular section will play on a loop directly on the existing Watch Page for all the viewers that click on your link. - Amazing, that sounds great, but we all wanna see it. So do you have a demo that you can show us? - Sure, I'd love to. - [Man] You first click on the Clip button right here and then you first have the ability to pick

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=120) |  which section of the video you would

like to clip. So you can scan, again, up to 60 seconds or as small as five seconds and find a nice segment for you to clip. And then you add a title. So here, these are Tom's Bloopers. And then you tap on the Share Clip button. And here, you have a URL that you can now share to any  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=150) |  of your social media pages or copy

the URL directly. Here, we're gonna copy the URL and then I'll show you how clip viewing works. So on clip viewing, you see that you have the information that we put in earlier, like the clip title, the fact that you've created the clip yourself. And then these two pointers inside the video that loop endlessly between them.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=180) |  So you can see that that just

looped. And then that's kind of how the clip view page works. You can exit this clip viewing experience by tapping on the X, by tapping on the Watch Full Video button. Or by clicking anywhere else outside of this area, including scanning on the player itself. So let's try it out by tapping on the little X button here. And you can see that now the video is just playing exactly where it was working before. Now I'm going to show you how to use Clips on a live stream.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=210) |  So here we're watching Valkyrae. She's talking

about her background and how she got into streaming, which is really great. That's a really awesome moment in your stream. So now, we hit the clip button and you can see it pulls the last 15 seconds of the live stream. And we can now edit around and see the particular segment that we want to highlight, which is about her story and her background.

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=240) |  Now, we can share the clip in

the same way that we did with the VOD. And this can be added to social media in the same exact way. And here, we're just going to show you what the clip looks like when it's played back while the live stream is live. So you can see this is the clip playback happening in real time. And you can see where it is in the in the video itself,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=270) |  in the live stream. And we can

watch the full video at any particular point in time. This is where the demo is of how to make a clip on VOD on live. Now, I want to show you where you can find the clips you've made. So on the homepage, right underneath your Watch Later button on the left side here, you'll see a Clips tab. You'll also see this Clips tab on your mobile device as well. So let's click on the Clips tab.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=300) |  And in this Clips tab, you'll see

a list of all the clips that you have made as well as a way to manage your clips. So if you click on this three-dot menu here, you'll see a Share button. You'll see a way to delete any clips that you've already made if you'd like to do that. Tapping on the Share button gives you the URL of that clip already, so you can share this again. You can also click through on the clip and start watching the clip again if you'd like. And yeah, so that's the Clips tab.  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=330) |  - So to recap, Clips lets your

viewers take 5 to 60 seconds of your videos. It gives them a short title and allows them to say something fun and interesting. And they can take the clip that is generated and share it with their friends or the rest of your community. Clips can be used on all of your videos, all your live streams with a few exceptions. Clips copy use on kids content. Clips copy use on live streams without DVR. Clips copy use on live streams over eight hours long.

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=360) |  Clips copy use on premiers while they're

alive. - Exactly and one thing that's really cool is that the playback of the clip happens on top of the video. So all the original modernization settings apply and the user is one tap away from instantly watching the full video or the live stream. This is especially useful during live streams. - Yeah, we definitely think our live stream creators are going to love Clips. They've been asking for it for a long time and we're really excited to get it into their hands. So the question on everyone's mind is, "When can we start using Clips?"  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=390) |  - We'll test Clips with a small

number of gaming creators first and slowly expand as we get more feedback. Clips will be available on all Creator Insider videos going forward as well. We've added some of our favorite outtakes into this video, so you can try the feature out yourself. We'd love to hear feedback on ease of use, layout, design, and any general feedback in the comments below. - Thanks, Saladin. We think you're all going to love Clips. So please try it out. Create a clip, share it in the comments below, and tell us what you think.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=420) |  From us, the creators of YouTube, to

you, the YouTube creators have a great day. Thank you so much and keep it real. - First, newsflash of 2020. (tongue rolling) (Tom tongue rolling) Hello Insiders, newsflash time. (Tom tongue rolling) Page on mobile. Why do I have these earbuds in? Well, I started with them and might as well keep them in. Users often think of their videos when.  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=450) |  Shit. He must be talking about recreators.

(laughs) Shit! (man laughs) Hold on, hold on. All right, Lauren, you got to cut a bunch of this shit out. So we'll start the interview now over. (all laughing) - Roger. - Your signals coming in five by five. All right, here we go. Five by five, baby. - Five by five, I don't know what that means, but good, let's do it. - It means crystal clear. - How's the background? - Japan, Korea, what the hell is I-E, I don't know, Ireland?  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS41x1YX1EA&t=480) |  I don't know what the fuck I-E

is. I'm gonna guess it's Ireland. Don't make no sense! ‚ô™ It's Friday ‚ô™ (Tom rhythmic melodies) That, hey guys, can you keep it down? (sighs) Kids.

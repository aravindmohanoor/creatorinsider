We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context.

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=0) |  hello insiders news flash time first item

we have pretty much migrated about 99.9% of all creators from YouTube studio legacy classic to the new YouTube studio most of you this has not changed much since most creators thankfully have been using the new YouTube studio almost exclusively there are still a couple of features that are linked to from YouTube  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=30) |  studio to the old classic system but

those will be going away in time as well very soon I should take this moment to thank everybody who over the years have given us a ton of feedback about how we can improve so YouTube studio particularly when it was still a beta I know there were definitely a lot of rough edges hopefully you'll agree that it has come a long way and you're just as excited as I am about where we're gonna take it going forward in fact bulk uploads for the new upload  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=60) |  flow is coming to all channels this

week this was a top requested feature for the new upload experience and you'll be getting a deep dive into that coming very soon next speaking of this migration from classic to YouTube studio that's also going to apply to the small percentage of creators that use YouTube studio through their mobile web browsers this is not the people who use YouTube studio through their laptop or desktop  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=90) |  it's also not people who use our

fantastic native mobile apps but these are the people that use our mobile browser and then try and access YouTube studio when you do that you're now going to be redirected to the new YouTube studio not the classic legacy studio since that is being deprecated next an update on YouTube analytics as you may have noticed YouTube analytics may not have shown you the complete estimated

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=120) |  revenue for a claimed video if your

dispute was initiated and then later resolved in two different months so it was a bit of a bug or a product limitation we are excited to let you know about an update to youtube analytics that will add more transparency to your estimated revenue earned per video for released claims so in the future if you have a Content ID claim that is released in your favor you'll be able to see that videos  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=150) |  revenue data in YouTube analytics for the

time that the video was in dispute there's no action required from you there won't be any change in the dispute process this is simply an update to how revenue appears in YouTube analytics now speaking of YouTube analytics I was actually just in a conversation with some folks from the YouTube analytics team and I was saying to them hey when you log in the YouTube studio on the right hand side you have that channel analytics card and it always shows you  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=180) |  versus your last 28 months unfortunately if

you had a really amazing previous month you'll often get all these like down red arrows and it's kind of demotivating and so some people were saying oh well that's just being scientifically accurate I am of the mind that of course we should show the numbers as they are but you don't need to kind of like lay into it just make it gray or something and then other people are saying oh well that should be a  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=210) |  setting and people can have it red

or gray so I was kind of curious what do you got where you guys land on that one it'll help settle a settle a bet within the team next I have a Community Guidelines update pacifically if you make a reaction video to a very dangerous challenge the video can be age restricted or removed for a reaction video to a challenge that doesn't have commentary discouraging the challenge we

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=240) |  may allow videos that depict dangerous acts

if it's really meant to be educational documentary scientific or let's say artistic for example a news piece on the dangers of choking games would be appropriate but posting clips out of context from that same documentary might not be so when it comes to reaction videos the dangerous challenges please be very careful be  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=270) |  aware it could be age-restricted or removed

what's most important is that you provide context next following up on the redesigned YouTube homepage for desktop and tablets we're starting to roll out a new design for the video watch page on mobile this update will be available to everyone using YouTube mobile app on Android and iOS in the next few weeks so what's in this update you're gonna see a new preview of the  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=300) |  comments section directly below the video player

above your list of videos to watch next you can either post a new comment or see a comment preview you can simply tap anywhere to view all like reply to more comments we hope this makes it easier for you so you connect with others and discuss the video you're watching in our early experiments we found that more people are writing comments with the new design so that should be a win now since there's limited space in comment preview spinning a comment does not  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=330) |  automatically guarantee it will appear in the

new comment section as a comment preview however when a viewer does tap to expand the comment section and view all comments pinned comments will continue to always show as the first comment other changes to this design include videos in the watch next recommendations will have larger thumbnails channel avatars longer titles and these features will give creators more space to tell viewers what the video is all about but wait there's more

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=360) |  you will now see community posts in

the watch feed and with community posts viewers will be able to view text image video posts related to the video being watched viewers can now respond by commenting liking and voting on polls for posts directly from the watch next feed in addition to posts there's also going to be these things called mixes they're basically YouTube creator playlists that have been expanded to include content specifically from the Creator that the viewer is watching in the player next we  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=390) |  are running a small experiment in the

US that shows some viewers of specific videos which products are discussed in those videos for example on a video about smartphones you might see a list of phones being discussed we're testing to see how viewers engage with these new features the tests will be running for a limited time next to support learners during the Cova 19 crisis we have continued our rolling expansion of  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=420) |  youtube.com slash learning to additional markets and

languages the learning hub is currently adapted to the following markets Australia India Japan Korea Latin America us Spain France Great Britain Ireland Italy however this can be accessed from all markets where YouTube is launched lastly arch what a long newsflash of folks who've okay lastly our trivia last  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=450) |  week I asked you hey we added

this new sparkling effect when does that happen and as many of you had guessed correctly you get the little animated sparkle in the YouTube studio dashboard on the snapshot card when you have a new number one video out of your last ten videos normalized for the time since upload let us know in the comments if you've noticed that little sparkle treatment  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=480) |  now for this week's trivia there was

a very very large change to the Creator studio mobile app in the last few weeks for Android so if you're an Android creator studio mobile app user there was a change and I think a lot of people have been asking about this or for this for many many at least quarters maybe years what was that change first person  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CExDc6saF4&t=510) |  to guessed correctly put it in the

comments below and we will give you a shout out at the next news flash in the meantime keep it real

Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.

product manager here at YouTube focused on responsibility. - And I'm Cherian, my team works on detecting fraud and abuse across several YouTube surfaces, including comments. We've been listening to your feedback and we just wanted to come on and give a quick update on a super important topic, comment spam. - Across YouTube we have many teams and initiatives that are focused on reducing comment spam and removing spammers from our platform. In fact, in Q1 of this year alone, we removed over 1.8 million channels for spam activity

chats for spam. We publish this on a quarterly basis and if you're interested in following along, hit that link below. - This is the tricky space, like a digital chess match of sorts. So we need to be thinking three steps ahead. There are several layers of defenses we've been adding since there isn't one silver bullet for this, unfortunately. Our teams are working around the clock to identify new tactics that spammers use, update our detection systems accordingly and catch spam quickly.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUwGspgeRVc&t=60) |  - There are a few types of

spam that we noticed recently, and we wanted to provide an update to our insider side. - We've recently noticed an increase in impersonation comment spam and what we call phishing scams across YouTube comments, attempting to gather personal information from viewers. Due to the complex nature of this type of spam, there isn't one fix that'll remove this content from the platform. Our teams are working on a number of launches to improve detection and stop these types of comments and accounts. We've already started rolling out some protections for this.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUwGspgeRVc&t=90) |  As an example, a recent fix added

more robust protections around channel names. All of these protections are automatic, so creators don't need to do any additional work to opt into these features and more will be coming in the future. - Additionally, blocked words and hold potentially inappropriate comments for review can be powerful tools in helping you combat spam. As a reminder, we automatically place comments that are likely to be spam in your held for review queue today. Sometimes these comments can seem totally fine.

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUwGspgeRVc&t=120) |  For example, they might say, I love

you, or I love your channel. However, we know that they've posted this comment across many different channels, in some cases, thousands of channels, and as an exclusive to you insiders, I'm excited to announce today that we're going to be enhancing our blocked words feature to improve broad matching and introduce retroactive application to blocked words. We hope to get that out to y'all in the near future, along with many other exciting enhancements, stay tuned. - Please let us know in the comments section

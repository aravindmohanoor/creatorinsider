#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=0) |  - What's up, Creators? This week's Newsflash

is gonna be an exciting one. We have a packed agenda, so let's get down to it. All right, this update is gonna make a lot of creators very, very happy. We've heard feedback that the ability to change your profile name and profile picture on YouTube, without those components changing for your Google account, is really, really important. And currently, you can't do it. But, over the next couple of weeks we'll be rolling out the capability to do just that. That means that you'll be able to update  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=30) |  your profile picture, and name, to be

more representative of the content that you're creating, without those components changing for your Google account. We'll leave a description of how you can make this happen for your channel on mobile, and on desktop, in the description below. But first let's call out two small things. Firstly, if you change your channel name you're not gonna lose your custom URL. Secondly, if you change your channel name you will lose your verification badge. You can reapply, but it may take several weeks

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=60) |  for that application to process, and for

you to see a badge back on your channel. Why do you need to do this? Well, we still need to check and ensure that the channel still represents the creator, the brand, the entity, that it claims to represent. Thirdly, you're gonna need to keep an eye on those community guidelines. They apply to all parts of content all over YouTube and there is no exemption for a channel name or profile picture. We'll leave a link to those in the description below. As ever, leave us some comments,  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=90) |  leave us some feedback. We'd love to

know what you think of this new development, and the process behind it. Okay, onto our next update. We heard feedback from creators that within Studio Desktop, using the filter 'haven't responded to', was rendering comments that you'd given hearts to. And creators considered those comments that you have, actually, replied to. So, as a result of the feedback from the creator community, we've updated the 'haven't responded to' filter to exclude those that you've hearted.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=120) |  All right, on to music. In an

effort to provide more recognition when it comes to trending and music, those videos that appear on the trending music chart, will now feature a badge. And that badge is gonna indicate their position on the trending music chart on the Watch Page itself. That's similar to the main Trending tab, as well as trending gaming. Clicking on that badge is going to direct the user to the Trending Music List.

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=150) |  And now I'm happy to bring you

an amazing update about YouTube kids. With YouTube kids now launched in new countries, including Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Turkey. This means that it is available in 107 countries, and 13 territories. So, that means that it's on par with YouTube main. So, congrats to all involved,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=180) |  especially all the creators that make sure

kids have amazing content to watch on the platform. On to an update about Shorts. The awesome news we wanna share with you this week, is that over the next week, all creators within the United States will have access to the Shorts camera. Now, in addition to the new creation tools, we're launching a couple of new features with the Shorts camera. Let's go through each one of the four now. First up; 60 second recording. Now, when you're recording with the Shorts camera,  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=210) |  you can see the option to switch

from the maximum duration of 15 seconds, to 60 seconds. That's the feature. But, keep in mind, when you're recording with music from the YouTube library, your count of 15 seconds. Secondly, we have shorts filters. You'll be able to switch to different filters in the recording and editing screens within the shorts camera. These will enable you to color correct or change the vibe of your shorts. Now keep in mind, this is just the beginning, because over the next year,

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=240) |  we'll be releasing a ton of new

filters and effects, so you can get the vibe you want. Thirdly, captions. Now, these are gonna be added automatically to your shorts, or you can enable manual captions and enter them yourself. Users can toggle between the two as they watch your Short. And, finally, we're adding a Shorts tab to the mobile App experience. This is to enable users to explore short content on YouTube, And the tab can be found at the bottom row of the app.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=270) |  Now, the tech team themselves wanted me

to describe, in detail, what this means. So, you'll forgive me if I'm reading this particular part. But, I want to get it right. With this Shorts tab update, Explore can now be found as the first topic at the top of the home feed. Explore is a place to discover what YouTube has to offer from up and coming creators, to trending videos, and destinations for popular topics. We introduce topics on Home to help you easily discover  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=300) |  content and creators that may be of

interest to you. So, Explore is a natural addition to this row, since it helps you find trending content from creators you may not have seen before. We'll soon be directing everyone to this new place for Explore, with in App reminders as we make this adjustment. And that's why I love working on Creator Insider, because of the fact that you hear directly from the teams that work on all of these updates. So leave us any feedback when it comes to Shorts  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V42uuQgSxU&t=330) |  in the comments below. And with that,

that is this week's Newsflash from the creators of YouTube, to YouTube creators. Thanks so much for watching and we'll see you next week.

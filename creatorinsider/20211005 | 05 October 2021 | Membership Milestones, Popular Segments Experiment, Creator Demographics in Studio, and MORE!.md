Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=0) |  - Hey Insiders. Welcome to Creator Insider.

My name is Abhinav and I'm a program manager at YouTube. I'll be filling in for Connor this week and I have a few updates for you all. Let's get started with our updates. We are running an experiment that will show viewers a signal that will help them quickly identify interesting moments in a video on mobile and desktop. If you are in this experiment, you will see a graph above the red progress bar while scrubbing. If the graph is high, it means that part of the video

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=30) |  has been frequently rewatched. If the experiment

goes well we will share an update here and explore how to align this with other retention metrics in YouTube analytics. The second update is actually a reminder about two-step verification. This is just a reminder for all the creators with access to a monetizing channel to enable two-step verification associated with the account ahead of November 1st to maintain their access to YouTube Studio. If you're unable to do so,  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=60) |  you will not have access to view,

edit, or upload content in YouTube Studio. Moving on to our next update about creator demographics in Studio. Earlier this year, we began a new effort to help us proactively identify gaps in our systems that might impact the creators opportunity to reach their full potential. We did this by launching a voluntary survey where creators can provide us with their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity. We want to ensure our systems do not reflect unintentional

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=90) |  bias and make sure we provide equal

opportunities to any creator and artist community. Our existing process is limited because we only have information about the content, not identifying information about the creators themselves. To better evaluate concerns from specific communities, example, concerns related to our monetization systems working differently for different creators, we need to have data about which videos come from  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=120) |  which communities. In April we began asking

creators in the US to voluntarily provide this information through a survey and in a few weeks we will add a setting in Studio where US-based creators can voluntarily add demographic information related to their YouTube channel. Creators can find this under settings, creator demographics. We will also leave a link in the description below with some more details, and now I want to talk about a feature that launched very recently called Membership Milestones.

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=150) |  A Member Milestone chat is a new

perk for channel members. It allows members to send a special highlighted message during a live chat which celebrates how long they have been a member. This feature is available to members who are in at least their second consecutive month as a member. One thing to note about this feature is that channel members can send one special highlighted message per month in live chat each month they remain a member.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=180) |  So how will you recognize a Member

Milestone chat? Member Milestone chats will be highlighted very similar to how new members are currently celebrated. Green in color and on levels $4.99 and above, pinned to the live chat ticker for a certain period. They will also appear in the viewer activity tab in the live control room. The goal is to increase the value offered to a channel member with no additional effort from you, to help you increase the number of members and incentivize them to stay a member for a longer period  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azCrNTClqQ&t=210) |  of time. Leave any questions that you

may have about this feature in the comments below. These are all the updates for this week from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators. My name is Abhinav and we will see you in another episode of Creator Insider. Thank you so much for watching, stay safe.

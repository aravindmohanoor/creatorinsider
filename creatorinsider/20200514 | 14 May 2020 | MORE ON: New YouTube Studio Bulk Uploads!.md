#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=0) |  hello insiders this week we have a

special guest we have a soft back on the show welcome back to the insider Nation a soft how are you doing I'm doing doing okay doing okay you know usual situation but the weather is nice you know fingers crossed that we'll we'll go back to normal at some point in the future but in the meantime work must continue to help creators succeed on YouTube that's  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=30) |  that's the name of the game for

our team right right and we are full steam ahead so what are you working on yeah so I've been working on the new upload flow which by now is already driving more than 80 percent of daily uploads which is amazing thank you to everyone who's been kind of like taking on the new Apple flow and the last remaining piece for the new upload flow that creators are telling us loud and clear that they want to see as part of the open flow is  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=60) |  the ability to upload videos in bulk

so we actually implemented that that kind of like capability and so let me demonstrate okay so this is one of my tests channels to use the bulk upload capability you would go to the create button at the top and would click on upload videos as you do normally and then you would notice that you can select files now and not just a single file so if you select multiple files and  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=90) |  prepared a few videos I want to

demo this with so let's say select those five videos that I worked on and prepared and I want to upload concurrently to YouTube I click open here and then those files will be uploaded linearly one by one and so we're getting this progress status indicator you can even navigate to other parts of the product mm-hmm and you will see that the first video being uploaded

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=120) |  is already showing up on the video

list and the videos that are still pending are still waiting will show up after that one and regardless of where you are in the product analytics dashboard you will always get this reminder and that's important because as long as those files are uploading you should not close the tab or closed your browsers because that will just terminate the file transfer and so while the videos are uploading what you can do is you have this pencil icon to indicate that you can start working on those  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=150) |  videos and prepare them for publication so

clicking on any of those videos would take you to the upload screen with the ability to add your title description a thumbnail a locate to play this etc once the video is done processing in this case the video is finished processing you can then add in screens and info cards and then set the visibility now if you are monetizing creators creator you might have additional steps in this flow this is just a simple flow for a simple account now you could always close this  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=180) |  model it won't publish the video it

will save it as privately as draft and go back to editing any of the other videos that have uploaded those are all done now upload is complete you should see all of the videos here in the video list now it's safe to close the tab close the browser close this kind of like status box one thing that comes to mind is ah is that this is a different flow to the classic uploads experience the classic bulk uploads experience it hasn't like  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=210) |  on one giant page and I know

in our early testing most people liked this new layout but some people were saying oh you know I kind of missed that like mega control panel vibe can you kind of walk us through the thinking on why we did it that way and and how we were we're approaching this yeah sure so the be kind of like legacy upload experience and also the bulk legacy upload experience was designed at a time where

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=240) |  YouTube had very few guidelines on how

to upload your video to YouTube you could basically choose which fields you want to populate which ones are kind of like suit your video for publication now since then and as part of the redesign of the upload flow in general we know that there are kind of like more requirements to prepare your video for public you need to declare whether the video is made for kids or not we want to  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=270) |  encourage you to add things like n

screens which we know are helpful and you creators love and use and all this kind of a conditional structure and additional steps we wanted to design in a way that is more has more guidance around it and it's more useful for creators this is why we allow you in this new bulk experience to upload multiple videos concurrently on the same page you don't need to open multiple tabs and upload a single video in each tab but then preparing each video for  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=300) |  publication is something that we want to

be help creators be mindful of cool well are there some things a soft that you are curious about that you want to get feedback on as you think about where you're gonna take uploads in the future that you know the insider nations always amazing with the direct customer feedback in the comments and I know you read it regularly so now is your chance to get some free user research excellent  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=330) |  thank you if you guys have anything

missing from the new upload flow like something is missing or broken or slightly annoying please let us know in the comments we want to understand why and what we can improve in the new upload flow to make it better for you and the other thing is specifically around like scheduling and whether you publish your video straightaway or do you typically go to private or unlisted and only then publish the video I'm curious to understand how people kind of

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=360) |  like schedule their videos and and why

what's the rationale you know I'm gonna I'm gonna throw out a feature request I can't help it I can't help but talk about this and not think like oh man I wish we had X it'd be interesting to see if other creators actually say well maybe I disagree with Tom I think something else is more important but you know one thing I've struggled with with both of the upload flows even with the new one is sometimes when I'm doing like batch upload and I've got five or six  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=390) |  and I wanna kind of like space

it out I have to remember in my head okay when did I schedule the sec upload and you know I often wish I could look at it like a little calendar and would have like a dot indicating like okay yeah you know if you want to have it every other day or frankly if it could just Auto schedule for me and it'd be like look if you want to spread out over the next week like we got you covered you know you should do it on  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=420) |  this day and this day and maybe

it uses like audience data about like when they're most interested or something like that that would be sweet I love that idea yeah definitely a calendar of you if you have a busy calendar or something to help you plan your publications again see how that would be useful for kind of like creators regularly upload to your question on getting feedback from the creator nation if you guys use the schedule functionality so basically kind  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=450) |  of like a fire-and-forget you do you

also at that time go to your computer and sit next to the analytics or the comments or you kind of like let it go live without attending it and then checking the all the the stats a day later or so I appreciate you a software coming back on the show and we'll see everybody in the future everybody keep it real keep it real thanks guys thanks Tom  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3_7aqa2mw&t=480) |  you

## Monetization Guidelines for Gamers - More Clarity!

Hello Insiders! Today we're back talking about monetization and gaming. As a reminder, no policies have changed, we are just attempting to be as explicit as possible when it comes to examples and definitions so creators can self certify correctly.

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=0) |  - Hey creators, I'm back again for

a second time this week. And this is to bring you what I hope is really good news. Now, what I wanna talk you through today is something that my team has built out. And that's a help center article, that's specific to gamers on how the advertiser friendly content guidelines apply to gaming content. You'll find a link to this page in the description below and I'd love to get your feedback via the comments, or through the send feedback link.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=30) |  Now, onto the actual content within the

page itself. It's called gaming and monetization. And what we've done is taken the top advertiser friendly content guidelines that gaming content typically runs into, and we've outlined each one, the self-certification sections within the context of gaming. So, the five sections are as follows, they're inappropriate language, controversial issues, sensitive events, adult content, and violence.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=60) |  And what you're gonna find on this

page is examples that are tailored to gaming content. For example, when it comes to inappropriate language, on profanity, we highlight that for example, a racial slur used anywhere in a video even if it's part of the game's narrative, that still counts as something that shouldn't be running ads. So ,to get a more specific example, if one of the characters within a game  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=90) |  says the N word, for example that's

still not gonna be suitable for ads. Advertisers aren't any safer on a video that would have content like that than if it were real life situation with two people using that word back and forth. Second example I'll give you is around adult content. Even if again, the games story is based on something like a strict club, the fact that it's fictional

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=120) |  doesn't make it any more advertisers safe.

So if you have characters going into a strip club and performers performing for them, that's still not going to be safe for ads. So what we hope to do in providing these tailor-made examples for the gaming community is really provide the maximum amount of transparency that we can possibly give you, around how to rate your content with self-certification. But also to really give you a sense  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=150) |  of how the advertiser friendly guidelines apply

to your communities content. So that is the core of the article, but it actually doesn't stop there. We've added in some bonuses. The first is a section on titles and thumbnails, and things to watch out for if you wanna make sure that you get that green icon. In addition, we have a section about applicable content types. So, when you know, Joe Soap thinks of gaming content, they typically think of recorded gameplay

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=180) |  but when it comes to gaming content

and how our advertiser friendly content guidelines can apply to the content that gamers are creating and giving to the community, it actually includes other things like long form content, uploads of live streams that have taken place before, and you just wanna share how you interacted with other gamers via the live stream. But also through videos like reaction videos which you might not immediately think are in scope of how we view gaming.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=210) |  All of these things are detailed in

the article. And finally, we have some added bonuses on top of that, and that is definitions. So when we use terms like focal or fleeting, they're really important concepts when it comes to raising your content with self-certification, and overall just making sure that you understand the guidelines that govern what can monetize and what can't. But we've never really provided a concrete example  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARV5QCDb2UE&t=240) |  of what we mean by these concepts

and in this article we have. So, that's it for me, we really want to hear your feedback so we can get more of an idea of how we can do better, how we can be even more transparent, and anything we're missing. We're gonna be updating these resources on a constant basis, but it's your comments and your feedback that gives us really good leads about what we should focus on. Thanks so much for watching, make sure you give us that feedback.

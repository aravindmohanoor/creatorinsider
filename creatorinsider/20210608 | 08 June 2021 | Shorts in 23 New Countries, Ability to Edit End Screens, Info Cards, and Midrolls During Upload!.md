#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gwfc4Q34i8&t=0) |  - What's up insiders? We are back

with another crazy edition of the News Flash, all the updates you need to know, coming directly from the teams who make those changes happen. Jumping straight into it. Let's talk about time. That valuable time that is yours. Previously, creators weren't able to do simple things like place mid-rolls, add end screens, or edit captions while the video was processing. So those critical editing actions, you weren't able to do until the video was fully uploaded.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gwfc4Q34i8&t=30) |  Now, today what we're happy to announce

is that creators can do those things like placing mid-rolls, end screens, info cards and editing those captions while the processing is taking place. Any feedback, you know where to put in the comments below and you know that we don't like to provide any news flash for that, a great update about shorts. And this one is stellar over the next several weeks. We'll be expanding the shorts camera to 23 more countries. Now to save you from having to listen to me, list each one

is leaving a link in the description below which lists them clearly. Now, if you're not on that list, stay tuned. As we continue to roll out the shorts camera across the globe. And now we get to my favorite part of the news flash, which is your audience questions. Now Kbalz asks, "If I drank alcohol on my livestream how does that play into the advertiser friendly content guidelines." Well, Kbalz, the answer is it doesn't. If you are drinking moderately throughout your live stream

icon at all. Where you have to be careful is around profanity, violence when it comes to gaming content, et cetera, et cetera. But just to confirm, if you are sipping from your drink, say a beer, as I will not with my water, I swear, then that is totally fine for the green icon. Then again, if you see a yellow icon make sure you appeal on the front end on.

flip it. All right. That's it for me from this week's newsflash I will be gone for two whole weeks on vacation. Avanav has agreed to fill in and I will see you at the end of June. Ciao.

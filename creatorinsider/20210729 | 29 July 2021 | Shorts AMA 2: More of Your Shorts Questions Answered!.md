#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsrkm3fTJ4&t=0) |  - Hello insiders. We're back with our

second edition of Shots monthly updates, giving you the latest on the product and answering your questions from our past videos. Now let's jump into the most recent updates to shorts. We recently announced that we rolled out Shots Creation Tools globally. As a refresh, the tools include a multi-segment camera, ability to add clips from your device gallery, a text timeline that allows you to adjust the timing and order of your texts and access to audio library with music, and also the ability to sample audio from shots and videos across YouTube.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsrkm3fTJ4&t=30) |  In one of our recent videos, we

talked about an experiment called Green Screen. As a refresher, with this feature, you can add a photo from your device gallery and use as the background of your Shot. It will be broadly available in the coming weeks. Now let's jump into your questions. Apologies if I mispronounced your name in advance. The first question is from Karl Rose who asks, "Can we make our shot longer than 15 seconds when using the shots creation tools?" The answer is yes. To make your shot longer than 15 seconds, tap the number 15 icon above the recording button

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsrkm3fTJ4&t=60) |  to change the length to 60 seconds.

We'll leave a link in the description below for more info. The second question comes from Evrim who asks if we plan to extend the amount of time for shots beyond 60 seconds. At this time, there are no future plans to expand shorts beyond 60 seconds. Next question is from Amitspro who asks, "Can we use our main video to turn it into shots by dividing it into five or six shots depending upon the video length?" We don't recommend this approach. It's better to create shots that are self-contained  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsrkm3fTJ4&t=90) |  and can be easily enjoyed by anyone

that isn't familiar with your channel. Next question comes from Evrim who asks about thumbnails for shots. This is a question that we get frequently from creators. We don't have any news to share in custom thumbnails right now, but we'll keep you posted in the future of any updates here. Next up is a question from Gamerturk who wants to know what the main differences between shots and stories are. Stories are lightweight, short form, vertical video image format built for creators to update and engage their audience. Stories are available to fans for seven days as a slideshow

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsrkm3fTJ4&t=120) |  of multiple short vertical videos or images.

The max length is 15 seconds today. Stories may show on the subscriptions feed to subscribers or an home feed or watch page to all viewers. Shots are meant to be standalone, Evergreen videos to build an audience on YouTube. They are vertical videos, they are 60 seconds or less built to empower everyone to be a creator directly from their smartphone. Our final question for this video comes from Lemon Dots who asks," Do you have plans to add major features,  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsrkm3fTJ4&t=150) |  such as stitching, dueting, responding to comments,

stickers, effects, beauty filters, and better gestures anytime soon?" There are a lot of exciting things on our roadmap and we'll continue to share updates as we're able to. That's it for this installments of shorts updates, please continue to leave comments and questions below so we can continue to address them in the next videos. Until then, keep it real.

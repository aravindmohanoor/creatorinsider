#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsnQ757AhQ&t=0) |  - What's up insiders? 2021, new year,

news flashes. Let's get into it. First up, we have a launch. Now this launch is around YouTube permissions and the fact that artists channels like brand to kinds now have access to use that new permissions feature. The way this works is that the owner of the artists channel, can opt their channel in using YouTube permissions. Now, what they will have to do is review their brand to kind of delegates and assign them new roles

Though, once opted in, the brand account management is disabled and existing delegates lose their access. So make sure you're assigning them new roles and inviting them to manage the account, if you still want them to have access. Let us know if you have any questions. Next up we have a metric. Now this is really gonna interest all the analytics funds out there. What we're doing is adding a selection within the date picker in the top right hand corner

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsnQ757AhQ&t=60) |  and it's called "First 24 hours." And

what this is going to allow you to do is take a look at the data of a video within that first 24 hour period after it was published. This wasn't available before. On top of this feature, you can also compare the first 24 hours of data for two different video side-by-side. Now this is only available for videos published after 2019, and it isn't available for live streams.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsnQ757AhQ&t=90) |  Let us know what you think in

the comments below, and we'll take that right back to the team that's brought you this pretty cool new feature. Next up, we have a reminder and this is about expiring held comments. As we said last year, any comments that are held, and older than 60 days, will start expiring. YouTube has sent out notifications through studio with 60 days plus notice. And last up, we have some good news that you're gonna start seeing over stories.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsnQ757AhQ&t=120) |  Mark chatted to a lot of different

creators and has put together a lot of their tips for 2021. So make sure you keep on browsing stories over the next couple of days, and you'll see those there. And now from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators, this has been my first news flash of 2021, any questions, comments, make sure you share them in the comments below or through the send feedback link in the description. Have a great week.

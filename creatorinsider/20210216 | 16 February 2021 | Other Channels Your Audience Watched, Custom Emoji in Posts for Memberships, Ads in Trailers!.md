here with your weekly newsflash, everything you need to know that's coming up on the platform over the next week. Let's get into this week's updates. First update this week is a new card that we've launched on Studio Analytics on desktop. Now, this card is really interesting because it's gonna show you the other channels your audience has been watching consistently over the past 28 days. What's really interesting about this is the answer to the question, "What can you use it for?"

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_ck6BiAwg&t=30) |  Well, best way to think about it

is as a report that identifies how your audience's interests are changing over time. Think about video styles or formats that may be popular that you could discover by looking at a couple of channels that your audience has been watching in addition to your own. Also, think about this as a list of potential collaboration opportunities for you. You could reach out to some of those other channels that your audience has been watching and team up with a creator that you may not have had

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_ck6BiAwg&t=60) |  the opportunity to reach out to before.

Let us know what you think in the comments below. Second and last update this week- that's right, it's a short one- is around custom emojis. Now, custom emojis are now available for channel members to use in community post comments. These are available for those channel members to use on public and members-only posts. So, get going, enjoy. That's about it from me except for one thing which is our questions segment.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_ck6BiAwg&t=90) |  This is where we take one question

from the comments that you leave under any of these videos and we go to the product team and ask them for an answer to your question. So, this week's question is from Isabelino Play who asks whether Premiere's trailers show ads as well. So, as we always do, we go to the product team and we ask that same question. Their answer was currently, if the trailer plays on the Premiere watch page, pre-roll ads would not be eligible ahead of the trailer.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_ck6BiAwg&t=120) |  However, if a viewer is on the

trailer watch page in its standalone video context, then ads are eligible to play. As ever, keep on leaving these questions underneath these videos. We really appreciate them. Why? Because we learn how we can get better at communicating product features and new things that YouTube is doing by reading your questions. From the creators of YouTube to YouTube Creators,

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=0) |  - Guten tag insiders. I'm James and

I'm happy to be back on the show. I'm here today to talk about one of my favorite YouTube programs with one of my favorite YouTube people. Pia. Would you like to introduce yourself? - Yes. Hi, my name is Pia. Thanks so much for having me and I work on YouTube NextUp. - First of all tell people a little bit more about what you do at YouTube? - Yes. I'm a partner manager. Which means that I have the honor to work with YouTube creators on a day-to-day basis and help them grow their channels. And as part of my role,  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=30) |  I also work on this wonderful program

called YouTube NextUp which helps to grow the next generation of YouTube talent. - So NextUp is what we want to tell y'all a little bit about today. I am a huge fan of NextUp because I've been able to go to a couple as a guest to learn from some of the creators and how they're using our tools and just from watching it, I think this program is fantastic and I think our audience will be super interested in it. So why don't you give us the pitch.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=60) |  What is NextUp? - Sure. So NextUp

started in 2016. So not even that long ago and it is really a creative bootcamp which is designed to showcase the next generation of YouTube stars. And we're trying to do that through intensive content strategy and production training. So each of the programs has 12 winners and they will receive a five day crash course at a YouTube space and they will receive courses on video production, content strategy development and the goal is really to educate and inspire them to take the skills to the next level.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=90) |  They will collaborate with other winning creatives

and also they receive a voucher for brand new production kits to help them elevate their channels. - That's incredible. So tell us a little bit more about the sessions. You mentioned production but what do you actually do? - Yes. So we have usually a whole week lined up of courses and events and amazing workshops. We'll talk a little bit more about how we're shifting now the program during the pandemic  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=120) |  but usually we have a week packed

full of content and production workshops. We hear from inspirational speakers, they join exclusive events, they get one-on-one advice from top creators, NextUp alumnis and they also engage in collaborations or projects with the other winners. - One of the things I've thought I've enjoyed as an outsider there, an occasional speaker, is seeing the way that all of the creators that have these amazing and different channels really become a community afterwards as well.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=150) |  - That's right. Yeah, they do. -

Yeah, totally. And there's a support group aspect to it afterwards as well. I'm not a top creator or even a NextUp creator but I can see how it can be a little lonely sometimes. You doing a lot of work maybe if you don't have a team by yourself. And then this is a group that understands what it is to be a YouTube creator. Can give you feedback, you can take ideas from them and apply them to your channel. - I think it's really important to meet creatives  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=180) |  from other verticals and other genres that

are not yours. I think you can learn and benefit so much from each other. The NextUp winners really enjoy working together and collaborating and it's such an amazing creative process that's happening in the camp. It's definitely one of the big highlights. - Beyond the production stuff. What other sessions do you do? Do you have any favorites or ones that you think people get a lot out of? - There's so many. For example we do monitization workshops

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=210) |  to really understand how you can monetize

your content in the best way and use amazing products on YouTube that make your own money with your content. But then we also have things like storytelling classes, improvisation classes, audio camera workshops. So much more. There's just amazing things in there. - Yeah. I know the last one that I was in you brought in some brands who came and said, "Okay if you wanna grow the kind of brand advertising  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=240) |  part of your channel, here's how to

work with us. And we're actually the people that would be writing some of these checks." So it really does help a creator that might be like, "I'm starting to have an audience but I don't know how you can have that conversation that gets you from zero to if not a hundred, at least 75." You kind of understand what you're doing. So in the past we've had these  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=270) |  in YouTube spaces together in London or

New York. We went to one together in Berlin but people aren't challenged as much these days. What's the plan for this year? - Yes. So at the moment, we're trying to do them virtually. So we're trying to still get the best out of it and make the most out of it. But at the moment we're holding virtual NextUps. - I have a little bit of an inside view. How are you adapting to schedule?  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=300) |  Cause I think this is really cool.

Is it still one week, on a Google meet for 12 hours a day or what's the wrinkle of this year? - Yeah. That's a really interesting question. So it's new to us as well. So we are experimenting with it and we're trying to spread it out over a couple of weeks. I think in India that did one with four months of a NextUp schedule. In Germany we are gonna try it now to do it over the course of six weeks

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=330) |  and we will have several sessions a

week over the course of a couple of weeks then. So yeah, we're trying to still have a packed agenda have as much of value as we can bring. - So you've sold me. This sounds like an amazing program. What's NextUp is next up? What's the next one that's happening? - So the next ones that are happening are actually gonna be YouTube NextUp camps in Germany and in Russia. So if you're from those countries, please apply. - And are there any things in particular  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=360) |  like who is this open to? Who

can apply for a YouTube NextUp? - Yeah, so you have to have between 10 and 100,000 subscribers to apply and your channel must be in good standing. Applications are then assessed by an internal judging panel and they're based on answers to several essay questions that you have to answer when you apply. - And where can people go if they want to apply? - So there is a wonderful NextUp page. So you can just go on the website of YouTube NextUp  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=390) |  and you will see all the different

programs that are coming up and you can apply directly from there and we will leave a link in the description. - Awesome. And so that's a good place to go to if you're not a German creator or you're not a Russian creator we do these in other markets. It's over time. Right? It's just kind of depending on the team and how much bandwidth they have. Is that correct? - Absolutely. We are doing those globally. So absolutely stay tuned, have a look at the website. And when the programs are open up for applying,  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=420) |  then you can definitely just go for

it. - I love it. Anything else you want to let us know about the platform or wanna share with the creators inside our audience? - I think that's about it. I would just say really take the chance. Be part of this amazing journey and meet other creatives and meet us. For us, it's as always amazing to see you guys grow and help you grow your channels. So I would be super excited to see a couple of this lovely audience as soon as the next NextUp. - All right insiders,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyr6lHV41Ms&t=450) |  that's all we got this week. Thanks

for having us. And we'll talk to you soon.

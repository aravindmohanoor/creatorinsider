#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=0) |  - Hello insiders, today we're gonna update

you about community captions. As a reminder, community captions are going away. We've got a lot of feedback and it's clearly a very controversial decision, but we wanted to at least try to explain the rationale and address some of the feedback that we had. That led us to this decision. So, let's start with some of the feedback that we've heard since we've announced this change. For full context we have other videos that we've talked about this subject and they'll be linked in the description below.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=30) |  But some of the feedback that we've

heard one of course is, do not remove community captions. The second one is, we really want community captions as an option. And three there were questions about kind of how we came to the conclusion from a data perspective, or why did we look at this data versus this other data, etcetera. So our number one, like don't remove captions. So just to clarify a few things. We are in the business of providing more captions on YouTube. We wanna have more and more videos that have captions,  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=60) |  that are accessible to the deaf community.

And that's our goal, so nothing else. We are not interested in less captions. So the things that we're doing to drive more captions are three. One is, we wanna have an integration into the upload flow. So when creators upload their videos, they will hopefully be very aware that adding captions is a good thing and it gets more audience and is great for more viewers to be able to consume the content. So that's the first thing that we'll be doing.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=90) |  The second thing, we've already rolled out

or in the process of finalizing rolling it out. But I think it's available to most creators now. Is improvements to the creator captioning tool. We will actually make it super easy to create captions because we will seed the editor with the automated captions at the correct timestamps, so it's really easy. I've done it myself, on the previous creator insider video and I had to change a few words that the automated system got wrong,  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=120) |  but it's basically you go in there

you edit, as you edit the player shows you exactly the right spot. So you can hear what you said. It's super easy. So we're hoping that that will be a material change it will drive a lot more captions. And that's already been rolling out I believe almost complete at this point. And the third thing that we're doing, is the new permission, that will allow a creator to invite a trusted person, to create captions on their videos, without access to anything else.

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=150) |  So it will be a safe environment

for the creator, which will encourage them to basically include more people from the community, but in a trusted and controlled way because at the end of the day, the creator is responsible in their viewers eyes for what's being said in captions. Hopefully, between these three changes that will be coming in the next month, we'll be able to really drive up the number of videos with captions and of course not down. And if it turns out that we made a mistake with this decision, then we will look at that decision again  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=180) |  and figure out what we can do.

And in the interim, we are funding creators who've used community captions so that they can use a third party platform to get community captions. The second point is that we're not removing captions to achieve our goal. That would be kind of silly to remove captions over all if we wanna have more captions. So we are not removing captions. There are multiple ways that captions are added to videos on YouTube today. There's automated captions and automated captions will continue  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=210) |  in the same way that they are

today. We're not expecting to have any changes other than improving the system for automated caption. And I should also clarify that we were not looking at automated captioning as a solution instead of human captions. But we are always looking at it as like a different thing. And we were comparing the sources of human captions. There are two types of human captions. One of them is generated from the creator, who goes into his or her video and adds captions.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=240) |  And then the second type of human

captions is the community captions. And that's where the community can provide captions for a given video with a whole system to approve it, etcetera. And we've talked at length in the previous videos about the complexities with that system. But that's the system that we are retiring. So again, the source of captions that's human captions from the creator is unchanged and actually improved. We'll talk about that in a moment.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=270) |  The only thing we're changing is the

community captions. Other issues that have come up with regards to community caption, is the desire to have the community be able to add captions without the creator being involved. And I think that that's been underlying a lot of the desire to have community captions, and this is a tricky area, but at the end of the day where we netted out on that question, it's important that creators have control of captions because they really are part of the video.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=300) |  And the creators audience will really hold

the creator accountable in the event that they have something really bad in the captions. And so, the idea that we can have community contributed captions without the creator's involvement is just something that I don't think we will wanna do and I don't think creators will want that to have happened either. So that might be a philosophical difference that we have with some folks in the community as well. There is a question of why now, what's not broken, doesn't need to be fixed.

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=330) |  I think we've explained it in previous

videos, but just to touch on it again, we've gone through a very significant update to our infrastructure over the last few years, creators have seen and that's the new studio it's finished rolling out. So all creators are now using the new studio. There are a few features that are still on the old system and community captions is one of them. And we really have to wrap that up shortly and just be done with the old system and retire it.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=360) |  And so this is one of those

last features that we were needed to figure out and I'll explain the logic of why we decided not to move it over. But that's the why now, answering the why now. Okay, so then talking a little bit more about the different types of captions. So I think what I'll do is, and I've shared this internally with the YouTube employees as well, but I wanted to show it externally. So now we're gonna look at a chart that shows the number of videos  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=390) |  with captions, human captions, by the two

types, creator generated or crowd generated. And you can see how this, the number in red, you can see the creator or this one shows creator. The blue shows crowd, and what's pretty stark here is the difference between them. So the number of crowd videos on a given day, you can see is basically like a blip at the bottom there. It really does not register at all. And the creator counts are tremendous.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=420) |  So, just one more data point of

why we decided to really double down on the creator generated captions. The next graph shows you how the consumption or watch time is different by the source of the captions. This one does include automated, but again, we made our decision based on the two types of human captions. So you can see that automated is a pretty small relative to creator,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=450) |  but again, the important thing is the

crowd in yellow is very, very small related to creator on a percentage of watch time as well. Those two data points really led us to the conclusion that we should be doubling down on creator captions, because that's where the captions are being created and consumed by the viewers. Hopefully that explains the logic of the first point of feedback which people really wanted to keep captions and felt that there was a negative impact on the deaf community if we didn't have captions or community captions,  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=480) |  of course we're not retiring captions. And

we are only retiring community captions because they simply did not generate a lot of captions for our system. So the second point of feedback that I mentioned, there was all that is well and good, but I still wanna have community captions. And so we have some thoughts around that and based on all the feedback that we got and there was a lot of feedback, we decided to find a third party that we've announced already too, that does provide a platform for community captions  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPYsu5nz3ts/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=510) |  because it doesn't have to happen on

YouTube per se. And so we decided to fund creators access to this system, and there was some feedback about how way YouTube is gonna make money off of this. It's actually the opposite where we're not gonna make any money, we are just spending money to support creators. If you've used community captions recently, we will be paying for what we said at the time was six months of this third parties system. But based on the feedback, we've extended it to one year. So, thank you for all the feedback  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=540) |  that six months might not be enough.

Now, the reason for the six months or a year is, we think that we have a feature that will provide a good amount of the value of committee captions, maybe not everything, but certainly we'll get to a lot of the value. And that's what we explained is a new type of permission, meaning that in studio a creator can invite another person, and only give them access to captions. So they won't be able to delete a video or edit a video  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=570) |  or see the revenue or see analytics.

All they can do is add captions. And so what that allows the creator to do is basically outsourced captioning, both same language and translated captions to other people in the community, but they trust. And so there is that issue of the creator can still have control and knows who's responsible for basically what they're saying, in other languages which in captions. And so we are hoping to ship that over the next quarters.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=600) |  And so that's one more reason why

we extended the third party, our payment for the third parties. So that until that's there creators have another option for community captions. So hopefully that explains the second part of feedback, which is like really wanting to have a community caption like a functionality. And then the third part of course, is the data questions about the data and I've shown them the graphs. And the one of the important points is,  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=630) |  there was discussion about low percentage of

watch time that has captions. And I just wanted to clarify that again, we didn't look in absolute terms. So the fact that it was, I think it was 0.2% of watch time had captions. That was not the data that drove the decision, the data that drove the decision was a comparison of the human caption sources, the community caption and creator captions. And seeing the huge difference between the two. So, we wanted to clarify that point.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=660) |  Obviously, there's gonna be less watch time

coming from folks in the deaf community than the whole universe of viewers. So, we know that and that wasn't the case. So the other thing to talk about is, I started with saying that we want more captions in the system and you could ask, well, you're retiring one of the sources. So how is that a good thing? Well, by not spending time on rebuilding the community captions functionality onto the new system, we can have more cycles to do other things.  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYsu5nz3ts&t=690) |  So, hopefully that explains our logic at

least, and we may still not agree, but hopefully over time we can update the community with how we've been doing, how the numbers are looking. And again, if the numbers are not looking good, then we'll have to make a change. Our goal is to have more captions, not less captions. So, thank you and keep it real.

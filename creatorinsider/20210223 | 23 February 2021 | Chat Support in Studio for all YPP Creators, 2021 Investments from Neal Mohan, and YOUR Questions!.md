Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcXp8fdw3U&t=0) |  - What's up insiders. This is your

weekly news flash. Let's get right into it. The first update I have for you is, the chat support will be launching to 100% of YPP creators this week. Now we launched pilot support in August of last year but we're really excited to announce that everybody in YPP is now going to have access to quick and easy chat support in just one click. Now within studio, all you have to do

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcXp8fdw3U&t=30) |  is find this icon and click on

it and you'll be through to somebody who's gonna provide you with some stellar support. Now, we're really excited about this because it's launching in all 16 supported languages. Let us know if you have any feedback. Next up, we have a blog post and this blog post has been published by one of the bigwigs here at YouTube Neal Mohan. He's a senior vice president and he's talking about product and design innovation in 2021.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcXp8fdw3U&t=60) |  Now this is really interesting because he's

really laying out the plans and investments that we're making and the fact that they're all centered around the creator experience. So we'd absolutely love some feedback there but more than anything, it's just a really interesting read. Those are the only two updates this week. But, stay tuned because we're gonna go through not one but two of your questions. So let's get into those.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcXp8fdw3U&t=90) |  Magic Mike, assuming it's different from the

Channing Tatum Magic Mike, asks "is the other channels your audience watches section ordered by percentage overlap?" Though we brought it to the product team and they said the results are ordered by the size of the audience or the numbers of viewers who watched both channels regularly over the last 28 days. So hope that resolves your question. If not, drop a comment below and we'll dig in a little bit deeper. Okay. The second question comes from Sofie Marie's cloud.

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcXp8fdw3U&t=120) |  Ooh, sounds very exotic. Who says "would

be amazing to see the other channels my audience watches, but it says there's not enough audience data. Does this mean my channel is too small?" We actually saw a lot of comments on last week's video about just this topic. So the product team want to highlight a resource that might help you better understand why you may not be seeing certain data.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcXp8fdw3U&t=150) |  A lot of detail is gonna be

in that link in the description. So take a look there and your answer will be provided. Okay. That's it from me and this week's news flash. Make sure you like and subscribe and make sure you provide us with anything that's top of mind for you in the comments below. See you next week.

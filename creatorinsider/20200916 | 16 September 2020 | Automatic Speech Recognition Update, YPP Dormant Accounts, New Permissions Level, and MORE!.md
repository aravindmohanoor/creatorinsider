#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=0) |  - Hello Insiders. It's your host Maria,

with this week's Newsflash. It was so much fun doing my Newsflash last week. Thank you so much for your feedback. Now onto the updates, your permission level now includes read-only access to comments. As mentioned in our interview a few weeks ago, with Chevy Duke, we added a new feature to viewer permission level. Previously users who had been granted viewer level access to a channel read only view without access to the channel comments. Now those with viewer level access to a channel will be able  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=30) |  to see the comments you've received, but

can not perform any actions on them. Leave us your comments below. Next update. A hundred percent launch see audience interest in your YouTube analytics. We said, we'd keep you updated on the progress of this new feature rolling out, and we're excited to say we're at a 100%. Creators can now learn more about their viewer interest by visiting the audience tab of YouTube studio analytics. This card titled other videos your audience watch

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=60) |  can help creators identify topics for new

videos, titles, or thumbnail ideas and collaboration opportunities. The data is based on all viewers of the channel over the past seven days, you are shipped from subs and non subs. As a reminder, you may not see this feature if your channel is made for kids or your channel does not have enough information. Next update, memberships custom emoji comments full launch. We've talked about this in a few news flashes, but now all channel members can use custom emoji  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=90) |  in video comments as well as live

chat. This is available on all channels with membership enabled and custom emoji uploaded. Next update, removing Dorman account from YPP. You may have recently heard about channels being removed from the YouTube partner program, if they are a below the channel eligibility threshold and having created a new content in six months or more. As YPP continues to evolve, we want to make sure that we're doing what we can to support our creators, who are making great content  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=120) |  and engaging with the community. And part

of that is removing inactive channels from the program. We recognize creators may be taking a break and encourage everyone to take the time they need. We know the active creators who take time off typically back within six months, if the channel has been suspended, it will have any impact on their future YPP eligibility. When creators are ready to start making contact again, they can reapply for monetization and YouTube studio once they hit subscriber and watch threshold.

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=150) |  Next update, one of the ways we

have channels reach a wide audience and improve accessibility for everyone on YouTube is by improving caption tools. Creators can manually add captions to their videos and also provide automatically generated captions. YouTube uses automatic speech recognition, ASR to automatically add captions to videos, and 10 commonly spoken languages. These are automatically generated captions are extremely helpful for many viewers and creators  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=180) |  who need captions and otherwise wouldn't have

had them on their video. But they are imperfect. They make mistakes. These results in instances where the automated caption were displaying words that weren't said in the video. To better avoid cases in which automatic captions, incorrectly display, potentially inappropriate words, we're implementing a new default settings, which will replace potentially inappropriate words by default with an open bracket followed by two underscores and a closed bracket.

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=210) |  This setting will not affect spoken words

in the audio track or captions or subtitles in the manual caption tracks and can be turned off at any time at the channel level in the YouTube studio. With this new automatic captioning setting, it's possible to still get the convenience they offer without running the risk that they might unintentionally offend your viewers or display potentially inappropriate words you'd never said whether you leave it on or turn it off,  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=240) |  this setting does not affect your video

monetization status in any way. We recommend you choose a setting , that is right for your channel and your audience. While we continue to improve automatic captions and reduce its error, we encourage creators to manually review and make necessary changes to their captions and whenever possible to ensure the best accuracy. Leave us your feedback below. That is it for this week's Newsflash. Let's move onto our winner from last week's trivia. The question was,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=270) |  what was the first YouTube original drum

roll please? The answer is Scare Pewdiepie. Shout out to Schauerland for being the first to answer correctly. And that is, - [Robot voice] Schauerland. - Are you ready for this week's trivial question? What is the most viewed YouTube original film? Please note there's a big different between series and films. Last week's question was on series, this week's questions is on film. First person to guess correctly in the comments, will get a shout out in the next Newsflash. Stay safe, keep it real until next time.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg7p6qmGmjk&t=300) |  I'm your host, Maria.

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=0) |  - Hello insiders. I'm Lenny, a product

specialists working on shorts. And today I want to talk to you about one of our most popular topics. You guessed it, it's shorts. And this video will address our most frequently asked questions from my recent videos. Our goal is to make this a recurring series. So please continue leaving comments below. First up, we've seen confusion about what exactly a short is. Shorts are videos That are 60 seconds or less in duration and our square tolerant aspect ratio. The best aspect ratio for a short is nine  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=30) |  by 16 horizontal videos do not get

included in the shorts experience. Next up. You've probably heard about our new shorts creation tools. So what do we mean when we say that there's a few things are included in the shorts creation tools, primarily the shorts camera for creation and recording more recent Additions to the shorts tools include the ability to add text your short control when the text appears and disappears. And then just the speed of your video as well as adding filters

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=60) |  you can also upload a video that

is longer than 60 seconds and cut it down into a short with our tool and use the same editing features as if you shot it with our camera. We also have a music library, which includes millions Of tracks that are free to use. Keep in mind that you can only use 15 seconds of audio from our library. If your video is longer than 15 seconds then the audio will be added to the beginning of your video. We've also rolled out the ability to sample audio from shorts and videos across YouTube. We'll touch on that a little later on in the video.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=90) |  Now who has Access to shorts and

shorts creation tools Shorts can be viewed globally today. Anyone can upload A short through the normal upload process. As long as the video is 60 seconds or less in duration and the square or taller in aspect ratio, shorts creation tools have been available in U S and India for some time. And we've recently started rolling out to 24. New countries. Creators in these countries will have access. Soon as we finished the rollout, we'll leave the full list of countries and the description below later this year  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=120) |  we'll be expanding to many more countries.

So please do stay tuned as we have updates. So You may be wondering, do you have to use the shorts creation tools for your video to be included in the short shelf? The answer is no, but we recommend adding hashtag Shorts to the title or description of the video. As this helps our system get the maximum distribution of your short across YouTube. Additionally, we've made some improvements to the shorts feature to make it easier for you to post on your existing channel. A few changes include adding a short shelf to the bottom

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=150) |  of all channel pages that have at

least one eligible short. You can order the position of this shelf or remove it entirely based on feedback from creators. We've started to better separate where shorts appear versus your long form videos were moved shorts from appearing and popular and uploads, but they can still be easily found anywhere that shorts are on YouTube. A few of these places are your channel page, the short shelf and the shorts tab. And we're always adding more and more surfaces based  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=180) |  On creator feedback. We do not send

notifications For every short upload for subscribers who have hit the bell and shorts notifications do not counter your daily Bell limits. We're continuing to improve shorts notifications to ensure your shorts get sent to the viewers who want to watch them. Another question we get frequently is do I need to create a new channel to host my shorts, or should I keep telling my existing channel that has my long form videos on it? This is entirely up to you. We've seen creators who have started separate channels  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=210) |  and others I've been posting to their

existing One. We recommend that you think about the style of Content that you plan to create for shorts, and then ask yourself whether it fits with the entrance of the audience already watching the long form videos on your Channel. For example, if you're a dance Focus channel that plants use shorts to highlight moments from your latest routine, it might make sense to centralize your efforts on a single channel. On the other hand of food focused channel Looking to use shorts to explore their knitting hobby might consider launching a second channel

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=240) |  to how's this new style of content

at the end of the day you know, your audience better than anyone else. And shorts represent an opportunity to try out different content and see how People respond. Moving on a big topic We've gotten questioned about is the ability to sample audio from shorts and videos across YouTube. We recently added this feature and want to make sure that it's well understood. So please leave additional questions if you have them. So what does this feature actually mean? Audio from any eligible Long form video on YouTube can be used  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=270) |  To create a short and every short

That's made with your videos audio will be attributed and linked back to your source video from the shorts pivot page as shown in the example here, this links back to your original video and provides a great opportunity for new audiences to discover and engage with your content in a new way. Our goal is to provide a new opportunity for new audiences to engage with your content and the new way and discover your channel. So how much of a video or shorts are creators able to sample viewers and creators are able to sample  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=300) |  up to 15 seconds of audio from

a shorter video on YouTube. Now let's talk about some eligibility scenarios. There are instances where audio sampling isn't possible. For example, if the source video has been opted out from audio sampling Or if a video has claim on it this leads me to my last point. What If you don't want your long form videos available for audio sampling based on your feedback we have released the functionality to bulk. Opt-out your videos from audio sampling in YouTube studio. You can also opt out individual videos as well.  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLQ5keuhN0&t=330) |  It's not possible to opt-out shorts from

audio sampling as always. We'll continue to keep the creator insider audience updated as we improve shorts. Make sure to leave your questions and comments below from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators. Keep it real.

Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=0) |  - Whatsup Insiders, I'm Derek and I

work on the Live Streaming Product team. Today I want to give you a sneak peek into some improvements we've made to premiers aka premiers 2.0. Now there are four total things that I want to introduce to Creator Insider Nation that we'll be rolling out over the next few weeks. So let's dive right in. And as a quick refresher, actually, if you're unfamiliar with premiers, it's a product that we launched in 2018 to enable creators, artists and publishers to turn their newest upload into a shared experience for all of their viewers.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=30) |  Who can then participate in the conversation

in real time through live chat. Now preparing a video let's channel as a schedule for the future, letting premieres to generate buzz around the upcoming video, were they shareable ,watch pitch. What we've seen with premiers is that in not only generates excitement in advance of a video debut, but also lets fans to virtually gather and enjoy this real time shared experience together. Something that I think that we can all agree is very important now, more than ever. And over the past year,

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=60) |  creators have really leaned into live products

of all sorts, including premiers. And we saw over 85% growth in daily premiers from over 8 million channels. Interestingly enough, most of these channels had never really used premiers before. So let's talk about improvement number one, live redirect. What does live redirect? Well, it's something that lets you put together a multi-part show experience by connecting your live streams to your upcoming premier and vice versa. So whether you're hosting a live pre-show ,interview  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=90) |  or a Q&A, our goal with live

redirect is to help you build excitement and engage your community in real time before your new content is unveiled. And when it's about to start, you can send all of those live viewers together to the premier watch page by simply ending your live stream. We'll begin rolling this out in December, 2020. The second feature update is trailers and you might've actually seen one earlier this summer on this channel, on a video that Lauren did with our staffs. So what our trailers?

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=120) |  Well, the less you upload a pre-recorded

high video between 15 seconds and three minutes long, that'll be played on the premier watch page and when a viewer lands on it before the premier is scheduled to start. This can be a much more compelling experience than a static thumbnail. And can get them much more excited to like the page share with friends as well as set a reminder so that they get a notification when you premiere is about to start. And in our early beta testing, we've seen some pretty incredible creative trailers from artists and creators.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=150) |  And we can't wait to see what

you come up with a drama of excitement for your community. We've started rolling this out this week. And now onto update number three, expanded countdown themes. Up until now there's only been one countdown theme available. And you gave us very directly feedback that this one theme sometimes didn't fit the correct tone for the content that followed. So we took that feedback to heart and excited to introduce more than 10 new countdown themes that span a variety of different content verticals, moods ,ranging from playful, calm, dramatic, or sporty.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=180) |  Creators will be able to customize the

length of these countdown videos as well between one and 10 minutes. In early 2021 these countdown themes will be available. So you can select one that best matches your premiere vibe. Let's talk about eligibility very quickly and I'll link the help center article below in case you want to learn more. But to start channels must have at least 1000 subscribers to access live, redirect and trailers. Our goal though is to make these more broadly available  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=210) |  in the future. For starters, trailer videos

must be public or unlisted and owned by your channel. So yeah, you can't use another channels video as your, from your trailer. Also know that trailers, if playback as the premier trailer context us will not be eligible to run on them, but if they're a standalone video on your channel us will be eligible to run in that context. For now you can only set up live redirect between videos on your own channel. And as a reminder, very importantly,  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=240) |  all community guidelines and copyright rules apply

to premiers, trailers and live redirect content. Now our final fourth update last but not least is that creators can now schedule a premiere via the YouTube mobile app. And with this creators can upload a video schedule as a premiere on the go rather than having to do so on a desktop or a laptop. We're really excited about these features and we hope you are too. And as always, we would love your feedback on how we can further improve and make these features more useful for you.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGhSrP3SmJY&t=270) |  We'd also love your ideas on what

new features we should be thinking about. So feel free to leave any questions or feedback in the comments section below. Happy for hearing Insiders. Keep it real.

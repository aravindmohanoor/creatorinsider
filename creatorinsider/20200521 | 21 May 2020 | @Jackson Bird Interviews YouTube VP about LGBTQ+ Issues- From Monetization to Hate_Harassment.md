#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=0) |  here we go so Tom oh he

says hello insiders this is Arielle again you might have seen me last video trying to get in front of the video a little bit more and I'm responsible for creator's creative products within the tech organization when I did the video last time I mentioned that I work with specific communities and verticals and see if we can improve things for them I talked about firearms and edgy creators and also mentioned LGBTQ creators one of our insider Nation creators Daljit Singh said it would be nice a little more  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=30) |  about LGBTQ and I thought that yeah

why don't we talk about it a little bit more and so we have the pleasure of having a conversation between me and Jackson was gonna help me communicate what we're doing and then asked me the tough hard-hitting questions and calling on me when needed but yeah why don't we get started so Jackson please introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about you and you yeah well thank you thank you so much for having me on the Creator insider channel it's been really fun to watch the channel develop over the recent years so it's exciting  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=60) |  to be here but yeah my name

is Jackson bird my channel is Jack is not a bird LEDs currently I I've had this channel since 2010 but I've been posting other videos on YouTube since like 2007 so you know part part of the arrow where the the brand cohesion wasn't really a priority but I make all different types of videos over the years I have anyways from Harry Potter to a cooking comedy series called will it waffle but for the past five years I've predominantly been making educational and advocacy kind of  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=90) |  lgbtq+ videos and especially sharing my own

experiences as a trans guy for the rest of the community on YouTube you have to start out by you sharing what's working well and what's not working well well I think I mean first of all I've got to say that it's it's very rewarding to be able to like share my story and share experiences and educate people on the platform and that YouTube itself especially for trans people back in you know kind of the late 2000s the earlier days of YouTube was kind of a game  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=120) |  changer for trans representation online and us

being able to share our stories on our own terms and get resources out to one another so that's always been the side of things that's really working but I think you know as YouTube has grown over the years and there's a lot more people on it and the company as a business has grown you know there's been a number of crowing pains over the years and I think for me personally you know one of the biggest places I see that is I guess in some of the harassment and  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=150) |  you know kind of like hateful comments

and stuff that will get left those can kind of be a source of the way that I choose to run my channel you know I have to be thinking a lot about my own privacy and my own safety but also trying to present a welcoming and friendly space for viewers of my channel and how when there are people who come in with you know leaving hateful comments or trying to you know target me that kind of thing can make it a lot harder to sort of foster that that  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=180) |  friendly environment which I think is so

important because as specifically a trans creator sharing trans content and stories a lot of people who are coming to my channel or maybe young people in a very vulnerable place older people - - who are like you know kind of questioning their sexuality and your gender and also like parents who are confused and trying to find a resource and what I would hate to see is any of those people who are new to this information trying to get an idea of their place in the world and they come  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=210) |  to my channel and what do they

see is a whole bunch of comments of saying that you know that they're worthless or whatever and so that's one of the the things that's always really tough for me and really challenging so I guess I would love to hear anything that YouTube's doing on that front yeah so we haven't I should just echo the comment you made about transgender creators in YouTube and I've met quite a few at this point and the key theme that always I feel strongly about in the reason why I'm involved with this LGBTQ effort  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=240) |  within YouTube is that that YouTube is

so important right that's it was described to me as kind of life-saving in some cases a transgender woman I met from Brazil who was getting a lot of death threats and found that found the community and out there and so it's so important that you get this right so specifically on the hate comment which by the way apply to many communities and actually that's one thing I should say also that a lot of the work that I've done on these verticals and communities applies to other communities  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=270) |  so that what we'll work on as

part of the LGBTQ effort I'm sure will apply to many other communities and it's kind of it we're developing a playbook of how to improve for specific verticals because usually at YouTube we've built general products and then we kind of figure out where we do we need to tune them a little bit more for specific communities a vertical etc so point is that hateful comments applied in quite a few people and but I'm well aware that in the case of LGBTQ creators it's amplified we've recently launched the helper review feature in comments I don't know if you  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=300) |  had a chance to play around with

that feature yeah a little bit I've always been a heavy user of filtering certain words here's a question that might feed into explaining the helpful review feature a little bit more a particular challenge probably for a lot of populations as you said but definitely for trans people is some of the comments that might be kind of hateful might not be using words that I could put into the filter yeah I should I should admit that I'm not the this is not one of my team so I'm not the perfect expert on it but  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=330) |  I can tell you that the theory

is exactly what you're describing which is and you're highlighting part of the complexities we face if you take a word without context and you make decisions on it many times you can have unintended consequences and so our systems I think are more sophisticated in that and we basically use a bunch of learnings from what kind of comments would probably be offensive we consulted with many different folks in the community experts creators etc and kind of built up the system to really recognize such comments  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=360) |  and we think that it's doing really

well creators who have it turned on and I think we're now at a hundred percent but don't hold me do that report that they get significantly less hate comment so have you have you tried to remove some of those words and just rely on the Health Review at all not yet cuz I don't notice stayed in my dashboard recently yeah so it's really recently rolled out to a hundred percent so that's that's like a big effort that we have to really help on that front when we just talked  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=390) |  previously you also raised the issue of

maybe it would be interesting for some creators to have less promotion as well it's unintuitive because usually I hear from creators okay you're not promoting me enough but it may be cases where you actually want to have certain videos probably not all videos go out to your community right folks who maybe are your subscribers or some other way of identifying them but not go out to stay trending if you're eligible for trending or maybe not to get overly promoted to new viewers etc actually do you think that's would be an interesting feature  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GYRoePIG9eo/maxres1.jpg)



#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=420) |  and then I'd love to ask the

insider nation to see if people in the comments would think that that's actually useful at all and maybe for other communities as well yeah absolutely I love you brought that up because I was actually gonna go there next and I think it's definitely got to be different every person that you talk to but I have a hunch that anyone in a kind of marginalized community might at least at times feel that way where it's sort of a catch-22 of like of course we want our channels or oh of course we want our videos to be successful but at the same  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=450) |  time when I have had videos that

are really successful can also be disheartening because they get this extra attention which brings with it the extra hate and it's got too much distribution you might have more hate than yeah exactly and I can I can really see it happen whenever I have a video that comes up and people suggested you know if they leave autoplay on and they're just watching YouTube for an hour or so because I'll see comments that literally say like why did YouTube think I want to watch this and with some some added  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=480) |  color to that comment and yeah it's

it can be tough maybe creators can opt out of certain types of promotion maybe even for certain videos like maybe someone's uploading a video it's like on the off chance this goes on trending I don't want it on there there is definitely a sense within the trans community and I would bet inside other communities as well where we're often like I wish that I could just post this video just for trans people like there was some way that the computer knew that you were  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=510) |  trans but of course there's no way

we could ever effectively do that because you know people are all in different phases of their lives and you know there's no way to actually do that but sometimes have you I try to think about okay we have that feeling we have that sense you know for our own safety for wanting to share these stories that we maybe don't want other people to receive in the wrong way so what could what could an actual application be from that and maybe it is something like opting out of your video being and recommended or something I  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=540) |  don't know we're spitballing it's a new

idea calling and obviously we'll have to Moodle on it there would be a very interesting feature very unintuitive for you to do the Builder so I know you know two big things that affected LGBTQ creators in recent years and I think are some of the sources of damaging a little bit of the trust in the relationship was when a lot of D monetizing happened that seemed in some cases to be targeting lgbtq+ videos and also when we discovered that there were a number of  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=570) |  ads being played ahead of our videos

that were sometimes for organizations that were anti LGBTQ and it seems like they were specifically seeking out LGBTQ plus videos that you know presumably maybe people in a vulnerable space for watching and that they could get on the side of their cons I think was a really tough thing for a lot of creators and so I'd be curious to hear sort of your perspective and what you think YouTube has done since then yeah so let's take care of the two questions one at a time so first on the monetization I should preface this part  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=600) |  of the discussion by just highlighting a

concept that maybe is not I think most creators understanding but it's worth just just reviewing it again which is YouTube is an open platform and being an open flat platform is actually a really hard job on the one hand you want to accept all content and we believe strongly freedom of speech on the other hand there are limits and where you draw the line is one question we always struggle with but beyond that is a question of how do you enforce it and  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=630) |  the way we've decided to enforce most

of our policies is with computer systems so that we can handle the scale right you can to have humans looking at every video and for every policy etc and so when you use such systems they have a certain amount of accuracy or right that's built into them and they will always have some misses and we spend a lot of time china tune the systems to lower the Moose's while still achieving  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=660) |  the goal so as an example if

we never flag any video with a yellow icon creator might be super happy but the advertiser dollars might die out right so in the long term they won't be happy and so we're constantly struggling with that and and the reason I give you have preface is it's very easy to also ascribe mal-intent to things that are tuning issues right and so I can assure you that we have non LGBTQ videos that are getting yellow icons as well and  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=690) |  some creators are very cranky about their

specific video they got a yellow icon and could also read into it some mal-intent that YouTube has in my experience there is no mal intent behind it usually it's just like we need to tune better on specific cases and so that that's that's how I approach these kind of discussions in general to start with specifically on LGBTQ we constantly try to improve the systems to make sure that we are we don't have an issue we're more yellow  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=720) |  icons are triggering for LGBTQ content and

there was also a creator who did a lot of research a few months ago that we work with that found some flip-flopping and yellow icons and we've since launched new versions of our systems in parallel actually to their work that fix the issues and so those issues now don't exist and so there should be significantly less yellow icons for LGBTQ content and but we're always looking to improve further it's just the  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=750) |  nature of you know you as a

creator choosing to join an open platform there's pros and cons other platforms work differently maybe you can get more certainty but the scale is different right if you sign a contract and you have like a bunch of lawyers and people clearing every bit of your video etc that's not how YouTube works right we're much more than we focus on on the open platform aspect so we do and continue to do a lot of work around the elec ons there was we announced I think a couple of months ago now that we had an issue with a lot of flip-flopping of yellow icons early in the early hours of the  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=780) |  video being uploaded my recommendation in general

and I'm certainly applies to LGBTQ creators is always upload to unlisted keep your video not listed for an hour too if you get a yellow icon you can appeal before it's public we also have self certification that's going out now which you tell us about what's in your video and the more accurate you are the more our systems start trusting your declaration and will rely more and more on you and so that's another thing that  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=810) |  would help everybody including LGBTQ because as

we learn that you know Jackson is doing a great job we start trusting you more and more and if our systems think there's something going on we'll be biased to take your word for it instead of the system so those I actually just got a banner in my studio the other day saying that I'm doing a good job with certifications there you go so I think they answer your question it's like it's a myriad of things that we have to do and we have to self  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GYRoePIG9eo/maxres2.jpg)



#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=840) |  certification and updating our policies is another

thing we've updated our policies that are off yet a chance to look at them but they're like much more detailed than having where they were a year ago and so trying to give you all the information so you know what's going on maybe the last thing I'll say is sometimes also with when I talk to LGBTQ creator there's thinking that the decision about yellow icon was because it's LGBTQ content and as an example talking about sexuality is a tricky area in general and it applies to non LGBTQ creators and certainly I know  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=870) |  edgy creators who get cranky about yellow

icons on when they talk about is sexuality and so if I'm an LGBTQ creator and I talk about something sexual and then I get a yellow icon I might think that it's because of it it's it's very easy to kind of conflate those two but I'm not saying that everything's perfect we continue to improve things over time and and we work with creators like yourself to come up with interesting ideas of how can we improve further one thing that I think you've gotten a lot better at over the years is having  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=900) |  sort of that like cultural knowledge of

like what what things do come from those experiences so for a one example this is sort of a weird example but I've got a friend he's a trans guy creator he uploaded a video showing him going to pick up his testosterone prescription and so testosterone is part of hormone replacement therapy for trans people and for us trans masculine people a it's basically steroids and we inject it with needles and I don't think he showed himself injecting or anything but just he was going to pick it up and that video got demonetised you kinda got a  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=930) |  flag on count or something like that

and I think that's one of those cases where you know a computer might see steroids and needles and be like all right yeah that we got a flag that that's not okay but within the context of it being like trans health care that's maybe a little bit more of a gray area maybe okay and I think that's like one of those places where you can tune it as you were saying when the people tuning it have that like cultural competency to to be working from there yeah and then so you raise a bunch of really great points so  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=960) |  the first is that the tuning happens

both at the system's level as well as the policies so maybe that our policies aren't nuanced enough right I will say also that there's another system that we have to try to improve on and that's this unlisted video review service that I think we reviewed on the on the channel a few videos ago and the basic idea is you submit a video in advance of publication and we have very senior raters look at it and they give you feedback but we also learned what are you not understanding about our policy so we can improve our policies where do  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=990) |  we have mistakes and so we added

a few LGBTQ creators as well so we start getting that direct feedback that that's one more tool and that those are the kind of areas where maybe we could catch these kind of issues and then again this goes back to my point about open platform this kind of the trade-offs that we you know I like to think of myself as a creator and creator insider so us as creators you have to deal with right it's sometimes you will get a yellow icon and it's okay you know like you you get more audience and and you know maybe that content actually just really resonates with your audience and you get a lot of subscribers and the  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1020) |  next video you'll monetize as well so

I always encourage greater to think also as a portfolio approach I've looked the whole channel and not every video has to be perfect because just as an open platform it's super hard to do the other thing I wanted to say in that context that you raise is you talked about kind of sensitivities and one of the things we've done is added kind of training to all our raters that talked about different communities and LGBTQ as one of them and we have an internal employee group that works on LGBTQ  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1050) |  issues and they looked at it as

well and the general feedback was like it's really good and you can imagine that it's very hard to train thousands of Raiders around the world with different culture background sensitivities et cetera so that's another step that we're trying to you really get into these nuances so that our Raiders know what's expected of them the biggest thing I talked when I talk to creators that comes up a lot is just notion of a from a creator perspective obviously you want perfection right you want the application of the policies to be exactly nuanced perfect in the context  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1080) |  of your video right and understanding that

these shots are of this kind and not some other kind et cetera but operationalizing that is is difficult and so we keep trying to improve and I know that we've improved significantly but there's always more work to do and that's why it's so exciting for me to talk to creators like yourself and to get examples of things that maybe we need to improve on when we do that constantly so that was sort of about the the yellow icon ad monetization but what about the the ads that were playing before the videos for a while yeah so  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1110) |  the same policies or the concept of

policies that we have for creators to get ads we have for advertisers as well so there's a bunch of different types of advertisers who are not allowed to advertise on YouTube and so there are a bunch of policies there we're always tweaking the line and making sure that the line is correct and so in that in those kind of cases the and I don't know that every specific one that happened it might have been that you know a Raider may be approved something that they really shouldn't according to our policy  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1140) |  and it's like a quality thing that

maybe we have to improve on the other thing that I tell creators is you can actually go into Adsense and there's some controls that we expose to you to say what type of ads you're willing to accept and so you could for example say that you I think you have an option for like no political ads right or things like that so you can control to some degree what ads are placed but we really rely on our policies that say like you can't have and I don't know this for a fact is I'm not as familiar with the policies on the ad side but I'm guessing  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1170) |  that you can't have like a really

hateful ad for example right so knowing that that Adsense you know customization you can turn some things on and off is really helpful and I think even that still has some tuning are there any other things that you're working on because one thing that I have definitely learned from YouTube is there's always more that you're cooking up though we haven't heard about so is there any only have so much time let me let me talk to you a little bit about the LGBTQ project that I mentioned the last video and that people wanted to  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1200) |  get more about and maybe would interested

you as well so we have employee resource groups so these are employees that are interested in different areas within YouTube and we have one for LGBTQ we have many others and the LGBTQ one has a few hundred employees now so it's pretty big and we started a project that you know I volunteered to help Shepherd to work on LGBTQ issues and figure out are the  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1230) |  things we need to improve on etc

and so we've been working on that now for I've been involved a couple of months now and there are like basically three work streams that were focused on and then I can talk about anybody interests you more or less so the first is product and so just the kind of conversations we've had like let's make sure that they you know yellow icon works correctly maybe there are ways of working enhancing it with new systems right or the pre review  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GYRoePIG9eo/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1260) |  service or they like self certification and

maybe we can come up with other ideas that are derived from LGBTQ work but apply to many other communities or maybe to all creators right so that's one issue and that in that context also of that stream is where we're noodling on this idea that you had raised of like maybe it's actually a less promotion option could be interesting for certain types of creators that would find it better the second track is that policy track you talked about how important  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1290) |  policies are and you know there were

recent changes that we made to policies to help among others LGBTQ when it comes to harassment to pay and so I think we improved their dramatically but we want to just keep looking at policies and this is where folks like yourself will help us figure out you know were the areas of potential needs to improve and I think I think you're getting a sense for how hard and complex it is to come up with policy so that's actually  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1320) |  another important point to just reiterate we

don't make policy decisions on the fly or like you know overnight these are usually multi-month efforts and we talk to many many constituents from folks who want more the folks who want less of whatever that policy is we look at hundreds of videos we have you know many reviews that we do to come up with the policy so it's it's tricky work and so we just want to take a lens of LGBTQ and see like are there things we need to drink as an example outing somebody okay  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1350) |  not okay look it's not okay in

our policies but there may be other areas where related to that we want to do some more work and really think about it and then I mentioned also about kind of how we train the Raiders and make sure that they understand all the issues related to LGBT so that's kind of the second area of the policies and then the third one is communication and how we talk to the community is you know I've certainly got a lot of feedback that doesn't talk enough to the community in general and the LGBTQ community the  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1380) |  creators that I've talked to reiterate that

fact that we don't have enough conversations and so here we are this is one of the efforts we're trying to do and and we'll see if the community wants to this kind of format or maybe this is something else we need to do we also want to make sure that when something does happen with the community where the community is reaching out to us that we have the right people involved in the loop including the employees are part of the what we call the ERG and make sure that we have looked the full context of  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1410) |  what the issue is that the community

is asking us so we can respond in a positive way and like I mentioned that what we're trying to build here is like a playbook they can then be applied to other communities and it look it'll be like a process that's hopefully very effective at making actual changes if needed you know there may be areas when we discover everything's fine maybe all our policies are perfect and we're good a little less work because because that  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1440) |  is a lot that you just laid

out that you're working on and so that's that's all sort of primarily stood by the employee resource group the pride act yeah so what we've done is we've used their thoughts we've also reached out to folks in the community like yourself and so we have a handful of creators and a handful of community leaders because I want to make sure that we have external feedback as well and so we kind of coming up with a list of stuff we think we need to look into or maybe work on and I think we're going through the procedure now validating it with this community that will help us and then  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1470) |  once we lock that down we just

start working on them and cranking them out one of my experiences working on whatever firearms edgey creators LGBTQ there are always learnings I would say 80% of the learnings apply to the whole platform and there's always like a 20% that's very specific you know I arms like there's a big difference between a weapon and a firearm and how do we make sure that our Raiders understand that and we need specialized processes to make sure we handle those videos correctly etc so like that's an example where like hey  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1500) |  that's the same thing same principle could

apply to these testosterone shots right if the rights at least like just learning can go between so one thing that you brought up one of the pillars or tracks was communication and wanting to be better communicating and this video is a great first step but for creators right sorry it's moving I'm not blinking all the time okay we'll see you know this is a step it's a great see but you know for creators who are not  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1530) |  invited to have a conversation with you

on the Creator insider Channel like what what are ways what is the best like most effective way that you would say an lgbtq+ creator could express their opinion you know sort of wield the power if they have a grievance or even positive feedback you know what's the best routes that you think personally yeah there are many routes so first off obviously commenting of this video I'll be reading it other people will be reading it so we aggregate you can't respond to every comment but we can aggregate things we also can't really provide tech support so we can't solve individuals like hey I can you help me  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1560) |  blah blah blah but certainly themes it

really influences us directly and what our plans are you know of course we there's always a social angle as well which is many craters are not shocked to complain at us publicly although you know my preference is to find a way of doing it but that's that's another way to do it we also have a creator survey that goes out I think it's monthly now and that's an  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1590) |  area where like we look at the

comments we read the feedback so that's a great way to give us feedback kind of that scale and then lastly I would say that again because effort here our humble effort has recruited a handful of both creators and community members I hope that you know you and others will be going out to the community and soliciting feedback and aggregating it up for us and then kind of holding us accountable cuz we'll be talking a lot and you know you can call on us and and you know ask us to tweak to stand the other we won't always agree but you know we'll have a  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1620) |  good dialogue and then if that's interesting

to the community we can share out you know the rationale for why we did or didn't do something that might be another way to do it so I think there are a lot of different ways of communicating I guess I find that when like working with you for example if we can be obviously critical of YouTube which is great I'd love to talk to creators who have criticism but also be constructive right and so look if we can find the solution and help us find a solution that's much more helpful than just like hey you guys suck and not give  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1650) |  any details and you know which happens

sadly but that doesn't really well awesome I feel like I got a lot of information from you and kind of got to share a little bit of my insight too so I think this was a good conversation like you're saying again a good step along that communication path and so you again for having me on the Creator inside your champ today yeah thanks for joining and again let's see if the audience likes it or not and maybe we'll do more of it maybe not  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRoePIG9eo&t=1680) |  but in all cases as tom says

Jackson keep it real thanks you too

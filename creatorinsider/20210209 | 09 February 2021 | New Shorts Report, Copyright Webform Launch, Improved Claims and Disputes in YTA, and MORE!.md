help build live streaming products here at YouTube. And today I'll be taking you through updates, as well as answering your audience question from last time. Let's jump into it. Our first update is around our copyright unified webform. We recently launched this new version of the copyright takedown webform, which now lives in YouTube's Studio. The new webform can be found in the Copyright tab in YouTube Studio, or by directly reporting the video from its watch page. In addition to the improved user interface,

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2igpJPM7oo&t=30) |  users will also have the option to

schedule a takedown to take effect after seven days. This feature was previously only available to copyright match tool and content ID users. A YouTube account will be required to access this webform, which will also allow you to keep track of your previous takedown submissions. And eventually, you'll also be able to re-track your takedown requests directly from in-product. Unto the next update, from the Shorts team. The Shorts team has started a bi-weekly forum resource

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2igpJPM7oo&t=60) |  in the Help center, called the Shorts

Report. This will be the official source of Shorts inspiration, product updates, and content tips. And if you're interested in getting an email notification when there's a new addition, simply subscribe to the forum post. We'll leave the link in the description below. The next update is around a launch that we had previously talked about briefly. For claims and disputes visibility in YouTube Analytics. Connor Ashley mentioned this in a newsflash from December,

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2igpJPM7oo&t=90) |  which we'll link below, but as a

reminder, YouTube Analytics will now start showing claims and disputes at the video level, whether the dispute is still in the progress, it has been won or lost, and whether the revenue will be back-filled. It will also give an opportunity for you to take further action, like dispute right from YouTube Analytics. Hopefully, saving you some time. This week's question is from Tech We Love, who asks about ads and ad playback within clips. Thanks for the question.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2igpJPM7oo&t=120) |  And the answer is that clips will

have ads, as long as the underlying video has ads. And these ads will playback the same way you'd expect them to playback if you started the video at the timestamp of the beginning of the clip. All right, that's all we got for you this week, and if you haven't already, smash that subscribe button, hit the bell to get notifications when we bring you more insights directly from the teams building YouTube. Until next time, keep it real Insiders.

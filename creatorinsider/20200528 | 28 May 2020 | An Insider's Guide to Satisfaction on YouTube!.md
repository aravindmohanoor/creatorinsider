#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=0) |  hello insiders I'm Todd and I'm here

with Eric Eric once you tell us about yourself hello everybody my name is Eric and I'm a product manager working with Todd in recommendations my main focus at YouTube is to work on satisfaction with recommendations what we do there is we try to make sure people are happy with the videos they watch from their home page or on their watch neck speed right yes we've been working on satisfaction together for a few years now and I'm also excited to  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=30) |  finally be talking more to creators about

this because it's really important to our recommendations so can you just kind of tell us a little bit more about what satisfaction means our goal is to make sure people are happy with both the videos they're recommended when they open YouTube on the home page and when they're watching a video in their watch later or their watch neck speed and we also want people to once they've seen a video be happy with the fact that they watched it and what I mean by this is  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=60) |  I'm a watch like three videos to

the end from beginning to end but that doesn't mean that I felt the same about all of them and it's important for us as YouTube to try and differentiate between the cases where you thought wow this was awesome I really I'm glad that I watched it and those were as a user you're like well you know I was hoping that this delivered something that actually didn't occur and on the other side for recommendations we want to help users find videos that they want to watch both  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=90) |  new stuff as well as stuff that

you they're already watching and we want to make sure that we're never showing things that are like turn you off from YouTube that you're like either offended by or or really unhappy about we know that watch time is actually a decent signal for helping us understand whether someone liked a video or not but then we recognize that not all watch time was equally valued by our viewers satisfaction is our effort to help differentiate when watch time isn't all

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=120) |  equally values so how do we know

if if watch time what made a user happy or if they were disappointed yeah that's a good question that's actually a big part of what we do we try to find ways to understand how you just feel about the videos they're watching and we look at both features that are on YouTube like did they press the like button did they say they were not interested on a video and are the signals like that and we also use things  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=150) |  like surveys we actually you may have

seen this we send service users and we asked like what did you think of this video and in a personalized way we use that to decide how high a video shows up on your page or whether we should even show that video to a specific user what is this what are the implications for creators yeah so I would like to say first that as always YouTube's goal is to help viewers find videos that they'll enjoy watching and satisfaction is just  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=180) |  a piece of that so as a

creator what you should be thinking about is creating content that is good for the audience so if you create content that's good for your audience viewers are going to be happy with it and the system is going to be recommending it to the how should a creator know whether whether their content is good for the audience yeah so this is there's a couple factors to this on one side when creating the content I would say if you are creating content that is misleading that's like click bTW  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=210) |  thumbnails that are meant to get people

to click on them but then the content is actually not delivering on that you can assume that it's less likely to be satisfying to users on the flip side we are still working on this but we would like to provide more signals to creators like we do for other things like click-through rate or average view duration so that you can get a better sense when a video is performing in one way or another what your audience feels about it in the meantime what I would

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=240) |  say you can look at soft signals

like our people commenting on the video and saying they're happy with what you're creating do you find that people like your video maybe you can even like engage with the audience really respond to them in those comments or make calls and reach out to them in in other ways that you have available is the satisfaction team working on these days we're working on a lot of things I would say our work is let in a few buckets one is to continue  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=270) |  to find these signals to better understand

how users view at the same time we work with machine learning systems that use this information to better surface recommendations that are good for our users in parallel we're thinking of what are other ways in which we can improve YouTube so that users are more satisfied what are some of the biggest challenges that the team has in understanding satisfaction of the viewers yeah we have several challenges  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=300) |  I think the biggest one is when

we either don't have a good way to understand how user feels because it can be pretty frustrating to be asked for every video like hey did you like this hey how tell us how you felt about this or what do you want finding a right balance between covering all users and not becoming annoying to users is is I would say the biggest trade-off we're having to make how do you think about like if satisfaction goes up based on a change but watch time goes down like which is better yeah that's actually a  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=330) |  difficult question to answer and I think

a good question we actually care about satisfaction a lot and I personally as somebody working on it I'm very happy about it but we look at satisfaction as an objective so if satisfaction goes up we are happy with that even if that means that users are watching a little bit less YouTube overall so what we look at is how much time our YouTube spending I user spending watching videos that they're happy about and if that time is going up

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=360) |  we don't care about like overall time

on the platform going down similarly we look at not having people be turned off from recommendations there's an important objective on its own even if that means that users are clicking on a few less videos we are willing to say users not being turned off and unhappy with the recommendations we give in a in a strong way is is important to us so do you ever worry about bias in the people  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=390) |  who take surveys so bias is a

topic of conversation we have all the time and what I can say there is we are constantly trying to both evaluate our data to make sure that it is representative and not biased but at the same time improve it so that it becomes better over time so is there like one satisfaction score for every channel or every video here what I can say is that it's not one signal or one score to rule  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=420) |  them all every video has a score

for every user and that is different for each user in each video and it might even change over time because maybe a user is happy about the type of content now and less happy about it later and there are a lot of things that go into that score you shouldn't worry specifically about like oh are the comments like specifically important or is like the like button something that's super important it is a  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=450) |  combination of all these signals that help

us make predictions for every user and every video do you have any questions for creators about satisfaction or anything you'd like to learn from the audience watching this video on one side I'd love to hear what are the things graders would like to learn more about right we're trying to capture audience signals how can we better help creators make content that their viewers are going to be happy and excited about on the other hand I think it would be awesome to hear from creators on what other ways could we be  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFs6rGS4JKs&t=480) |  measuring user satisfaction how can we continue

to learn how users feel about the videos they're watching great so if you have ideas for satisfaction please leave them in the comments if you were satisfied by this video what should they do err I think they said like subscribe and comment if you enjoyed this video and want to see some more creator insider videos about recommendations and our search and discovery systems please

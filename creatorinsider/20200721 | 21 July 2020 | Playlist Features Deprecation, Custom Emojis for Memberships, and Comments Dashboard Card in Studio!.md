Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=0) |  - All right insiders, we are back.

And you've guessed it. We are starting our news flash with a flash back. If you're missing Tom, like the rest of us, you'll be happy to know that his collaboration Part Two with Tim, from Video Creators is now live. We'll be leaving a link in the description. So check it out and leave him a couple of comments to let him know that he's missed. Okay, update number two, back to analytics. We talked to you through the new feature,  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=30) |  other videos your audiences watched. And we

wanted to keep you updated as promised, with the progress of the roll edge. By July 22, we're hoping for a 40% launch. Quick reminder, if you're not seeing this feature in studio, it's indicative of either your content being made for kids or they're just simply not being enough data associated with your channel in order to launch a team. So we'll continue to keep you posted and we'll check in with you over the coming weeks.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=60) |  Next up, we have some great news

around the ability to change your avatar, otherwise known as your profile photo on your channel. Up until now, you've only ever been able to do this on YouTube main on desktop. But what we're hoping to have happen by the end of this month, July is to have the ability to do that on the YouTube made up both for iOS and Android. So stay tuned, you'll hear it here first, and we hope you're looking forward to this update.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=90) |  Next up, we have some great news

around custom emojis for memberships. That's right, you guessed it up until now, you have been able. If you've enabled memberships on your channel to upload custom emojis which members can use on things like live chats and premieres. But wait, we're bringing out a launch, whereby creators can upload custom emojis which members can use in public  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=120) |  and members only video comments. Mind blown.

Not for all of you though because if you notice, I left a hint around this in last week's video in the trivia question. Now this has been a long standing feature requests from the community both from members and the creators that the members follow. So we're really happy to be bringing it out to the community. Next question is, when are we rolling it edge? Well, we're going to be rolling it out slowly  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=150) |  over the next couple of weeks. So

stay tuned. We'll alert you when it's live for your channel. But hopefully you'll see some of those custom emojis being used by your members first. And next up, we have the return of a top requested product feature. This is a new comments card which you will be able to see in the studio desktop dashboard. Now what's it going to do? It is going to show you the comments across your channel  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=180) |  which you have yet to engage with.

And it's going to show you the latest comments first. So thank you so much for the feedback that you've been providing to us as ever. It's what drives the focus of many product in engineering teams. Next up, we have improved info card experience. This is something that James ran through and did a quick demo of two news flashes ago. So let's do a quick recap. This is 100% live for 100% of creators, and it's an improved info card experience in studio.

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=210) |  Why is it improved? Well, it's faster,

it's easier. It has a better user interface, but I hear you yell, Connor, those are all buzzwords we've heard them before, give us the actual details. What's the benefit? Well, imagine a universe in which you can add an info card while up loading a video? You can do this in the video details section  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=240) |  and in the full screen editor. But

wait, there's more. The icing on the cake. No more opening another tab. You can do it all in the one tab. Thanks to James and his team for this fantastic update. It's been something that's been requested from creators for quite a while, enjoy. All right, last update before the trivia which I know you cannot wait for after seeing such high engagement with emojis  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=270) |  within the comments last week. We're going

to talk about the deprecation of a couple of playlist features that you're not going to see as you move from classic studio to new studio. Now we are deprecating these five which you'll have to forgive me. I'm going to read at this time because I didn't have time to memorize them. They are video notes, remove duplicate videos, set as official series, auto add video rules, and translate playlists.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=300) |  So our goal is always to make

sure that we're working on the features that are going to see the most usage and add the most value for the most numbers of creators. So if you have any feedback on the playlist feature as you'll see it in your studio, this is the place to come. Leave us a couple of comments beneath. As you know, we always read every single one of them. All right, and just before we get to the trivia, one thing I wanted to go through, which I didn't get a chance to at the start was what I learned over the last week  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IHCCbDGWgIg/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=330) |  about what it's like being a creator.

And something that I think is quite obvious, but has a huge impact is the yellow icon. And what the experience of it is like when one is applied to your video. And when there's, from your point of view, very little information as to why? You probably heard about self certification and writing your own content. So we're going to leave a link in the description to a Help Center article that my team is working on,  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=360) |  and we're going to try and update

a couple of times for the rest of the year. The question I have for you is, what is missing within that article? What could we be adding in there to better represent content that's on the platform or a content area that you might just be confused about? Leave some comments below. I'll read through them and I'll go through them with my team. We'll have some more updates around self certification over the next couple of weeks and some updates that we're making the questionnaire  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=390) |  But now to the trivia. All right,

and last week's winner of the emoji based trivia question, first of its kind, is Justin Henton. Justin, thanks so much for jumping in there and getting the right emoji and making sure that you got to call it this week. Now a little tip for everybody. If you watch Justin's proposal video on his channel, you'll be blown away.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=420) |  Some really beautiful content there. And now,

this week's trivia question, in what year did YouTube start serving ads and allowing monetization through mid rolls and pre rolls etc, etc? Leave your answer in the comments below and next week, I will come back not only with the winner, but with a nice little shout out as well. As ever leave comments below with suggestions  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHCCbDGWgIg&t=450) |  as to how I can make this

a little bit better. So have a nice week in the meantime and as ever, keep it real.

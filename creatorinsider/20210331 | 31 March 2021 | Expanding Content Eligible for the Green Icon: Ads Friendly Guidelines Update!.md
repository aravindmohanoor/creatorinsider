#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhEUFldb1lU&t=0) |  - All right folks, back with a

special update this week, this one's important, and I'm especially excited, because of the fact that it's something that I worked on, directly myself. Now across the company, we're really aware, that when you receive a yellow icon on your content, it can feel as if YouTube, isn't being supportive. The advertiser friendly guidelines are restrictive, in some areas more than others, because advertisers want the option, to opt in, on some content. And in others have no tolerance

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhEUFldb1lU&t=30) |  for running ads. Examples of those kind

of areas are, content which features graphic dead bodies or really detailed discussions around sexual abuse. So it's really a balancing act for us, making sure that you have the best possible opportunity to monetize your content on the platform, while making sure that advertisers are still happy to pay for ad space, makes sense. You can't really have one without the other. So to the update itself,

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhEUFldb1lU&t=60) |  we've taken time to meet with advertisers

and we've made the case for some responsible policy updates. That means that, there are now going to be more opportunities, for you to fully monetize your content. Whereas before, some of this content, would have received the yellow icon. What we're talking about here is moving, specific content areas, out of scope of the yellow icon, and moving it in scope of the green icon. Firstly, we're going to expand monetization, on educational documentary

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhEUFldb1lU&t=90) |  or news content, that may feature violent

interactions with law enforcement, recreational drugs or drug related content, as well as sensitive events. Second, we're expanding monetization around controversial issues, where the content isn't graphic, and it's an objective discussion of controversial issues. And lastly, we're expanding monetization, in the area of adult themes, delivered through the context of humor. For example, more adult dating jokes.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhEUFldb1lU&t=120) |  In addition to this, we're expanding monetization,

applying the green icon, where there is use of moderate profanity, within the first 30 seconds of your video. So, to summarize these are updates, to the advertiser friendly content guidelines, that are moving specific content areas, out of the scope of the yellow icon, and under the umbrella, of the green icon. You can find a link in the description, if you want to read more on these updates. From the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators, this has been a special update

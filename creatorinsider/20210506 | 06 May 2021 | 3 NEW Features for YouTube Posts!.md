#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbBdkuCA_fY&t=0) |  - Hello insiders and welcome to Creator

Insider. My name is Abinav and I'm a program manager at YouTube. Today we have with us Omar, who is going to talk about some exciting launches with regards to posts. Hey Omar, would you like to introduce yourself to our Creator Insider audience? - Sure thing. Hi Insiders, I'm Omar. A product manager working on Community, specifically posts. - Awesome. So let's talk about what's really launching. - Absolutely. So today I want to talk about three new launches coming to posts. The first is a highly requested feature:

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbBdkuCA_fY&t=30) |  The ability to see post metrics in

YTA. Creators have been asking us for more in-depth analytics, to better understand the return on investment for posts. Any creator globally, with a thousand or more subs, will be able to see their impressions and engagement rates in YTA. As of now, these metrics will only appear on desktop but we're planning on bringing them to Studio Mobile in the future. Creators will be able to see how many times their posts was shown and how their fans are responding to it. Creators will be able to better understand how their posts are performing with their audience

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbBdkuCA_fY&t=60) |  and can use these insights to guide

their posting strategy. - This sounds like a great addition to posts. You said there are three launches. What is the second launch about? - Yeah! So the second launch is the ability to add multiple images to a post. Creators have been asking for the ability to share more images in their posts like they can on competitive platforms. Up until now, they can only add one. With this launch, creators will be able to add up to five images to a post. Our goal with this launch is to offer creators more ability to express themselves

Similar to YTA for posts this will be available to creators with a thousand or more subs. At the moment this feature will only be available on Android but we're planning to expand this feature to iOS and desktop this year. - Very cool I'm pretty sure everyone who's watching this is going to be super excited about all these but we are not stopping there. So, could you please talk a little bit about the third launch? - So this third launch is the ability to schedule posts on iOS. This already exists for creators on desktop and Android  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbBdkuCA_fY&t=120) |  but this launch will help all creators

save time and increase efficiency when sharing content. - All right. So all of these changes, they sound fantastic. Is there anything else you want to tell our audience about while you're here? - Nothing specific, but we'd love your feedback once these features are live. - Well, with that we have come to the end of this episode. Thank you so much Omar, for taking out time and talking to us today and announcing these exciting things about posts. We would love to have you back on the show and for our Creator audience, keep it real.

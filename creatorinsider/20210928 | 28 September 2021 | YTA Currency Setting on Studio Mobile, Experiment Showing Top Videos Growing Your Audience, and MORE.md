week's News Flash. Let's get into those updates. Now let's talk about a really exciting launch. The launch of three new metrics previously only available on desktop, now brought to Studio. The first of these metrics is the addition of new and returning viewer metrics under the Audience tab of Channel and Video Analytics. The second metric is the introduction of members metrics under the Audience tab of Channel Analytics.

Latest video performance card on the dashboard to those on desktop. Now this view also provides a brief insight into CTR performance. Let's return to one of our favorite topics, and that is money! This is the launch of YouTube Analytics currency settings on Studio mobile. In response to your feedback, and in an effort to bring more features from Studio desktop to Studio mobile,

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNSj8V__nuk&t=60) |  we're adding the ability for creators to

change their currency settings on Studio mobile. To do this, go to settings, and take a look under Comment notifications in the Studio mobile app. We're rolling this out over the next couple of weeks, so make sure to give us some early feedback as soon as you can. Let's discuss another exciting launch. This time the launch of bottom navigation for Studio mobile. If you've a really good memory, you'll remember that in a sneak peak last year Lovoro mentioned new improvements  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNSj8V__nuk&t=90) |  that were designed to optimize the experience

of Studio mobile for creators. Now over the next few weeks, we'll be rolling out bottom navigation, currently only available on the YouTube main app for Studio mobile. The goal of this, verses the current side bar navigation, is to increase efficiency by reducing the number of navigational clicks that you have to make on Studio mobile. Before we go, we can't pass up the opportunity to let you know about a really interesting experiment.

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNSj8V__nuk&t=120) |  This experiment is called Top Videos Growing

Your Audience. And it's based on a card that we're experimenting with under the Audience tab within Analytics, that's going to show you which videos are helping to grow your audience. The card will list videos based in descending order based on the number of new viewers that returned to watch more. What's the goal of this? Well the goal is to help you understand what types of content your audience is enjoying the most,  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNSj8V__nuk&t=150) |  and what types of content you might

want to make more of to grow that audience. If you're in the experiment, leave us some feedback in the comments below. And that's about it for this week's News Flash. From the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators, thanks so much for tuning in, and we'll see you next week.

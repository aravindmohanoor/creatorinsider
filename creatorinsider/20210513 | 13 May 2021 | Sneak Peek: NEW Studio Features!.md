#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_MBzGB4Nv0&t=0) |  - Creators, it's Assaf from the studio

team. I'm here to give you a quick sneak peek into some of the cool features we're working on. One improvement we're working on is to make upload defaults more powerful. We wanna bring upload defaults to mobile, allow multiple upload templates, and also allow you to quickly and easily clone your settings from one of your previous videos, so you don't need to retype everything each time you upload. Another cool improvement we're working on is upload from drive.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_MBzGB4Nv0&t=30) |  So hopefully we'll be able to save

a ton of time and bandwidth and storage on your device by allowing it to just upload videos that are already essentially on your cloud drive folder. We've recently launched pre-published checks on desktop. And so we're now working to bring that capability into mobile uploads and also improve the ways you can resolve issues, undergo and be notified quicker whenever there is an issue with your video, stay tuned for that one.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_MBzGB4Nv0&t=60) |  We are also working on more futuristic

stuff like auto-generated description and title, and enhancing your thumbnails based on the latest AI models that we have, so stay tuned for those improvements as well in the product. If there is anything you'd like to see added to studio across mobile or desktop, let us know in the comments below, thank you for tuning in.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qFgDls7iFc&t=30) |  Now this launch is expanding as of

last week to the United States that began on March 18th. Stay tuned for more exciting updates about shorts on as ever, if you have any feedback, you know where to leave them, in the comments below. Now, before we get to the audience questions, I wanna share a tip related to YouTube analytics that the team helped a creator answer last week just in case anybody was wondering about the same thing. This question from the creator was around digging into external data sources

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qFgDls7iFc&t=60) |  at the video level. The creator thought

it was only available at the channel level. So we thought we would clarify. If you want to dig into where traffic is coming from, for example, Instagram or Twitter, you can do this. Go into studio analytics, change the date picker to lifetime, click on advanced analytics for that specific video and click on external. And you could dig in that one further level. Now, onto the audience question.

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qFgDls7iFc&t=90) |  Michael Daniels asked, I would love to

see clearly when I have subscribers that drop. No names, just numbers. I would like to see growth and loss lists like 23 gained and six lost. Now that does sound like my battle with the COVID pains. But unlike that battle, we have good news to deliver in this context. This is actually already available. So if you go into analytics and click in the top right on advanced mode and switch to subscribers source, you're gonna find that data there.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qFgDls7iFc&t=120) |  So we hope that helps. And as

ever make sure you leave a question in the comments if there's something that you just want a little bit of help on, And as ever from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators, I'm Ben Connor, this is Creator Insider. Make sure you subscribe, see you next week.

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=0) |  - What's up insiders, today we're here

with Lovro, who's gonna talk to us about what the Studio Mobile Team has been up to these past couple of months since they launched Dark Mode, and what we can expect for the rest of 2020, and going into 2021 as well. So welcome to the show Lovro. - Hey insiders, thanks a lot for having us on the show. We're really happy to talk about mobile. - Okay, so the last time we spoke to you, we had just unveiled Dark Mode for Studio Mobile. What is the team been up to since then? - Yeah, sure. So the Studio Mobile Team has recently like started focusing on mobile again,  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=30) |  and so there have been a lot

of like cleanups we needed to do so in the beginning of the year, we talked about YouTube analytics. So we introduced, your Latest Video Performance, Impressions, Click-through rates, Headlines in Dark Mode. And since then we have been really working hard on launching a New Metadata Editor. So better editing your title, description visibility, so we have a new UI and you have a better tech stack, so we can build more features for you. - Okay, so the team has actually been up to a lot.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=60) |  Can we expect anything else for 2020?

- Yeah, absolutely, so our team is working on a couple of more things. So one is comments sorting, we will improve on the video page. So when you go to a video, you click on comments of that video, you usually see your video sorted by most recent, and now we will switch that, that you can select between most recent or your top comments. In addition, we will bring sorting and filtering of videos to the video list. So you can better sort by publish date or number of views or your privacy,  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=90) |  and it will allow us to bring

even more filters, like number of views, comments, copyrights and so on. We also are launching the known issues card, so if there's any outage on YouTube Studio, you will actually be able to see that. - So that covers the Studio Mobile App, but what can we expect in main app? Are there any improvements? - Oh, that's actually a really good point. So all these improvements are in the YouTube Studio app. So that's a separate app from the YouTube main app, but in the YouTube main app, there's the mobile upload flow. And our team is also working on this one,  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=120) |  so we also bring this New Metadata

Editor to the mobile upload flow. And you will now be able to schedule immediately, while you upload for the video to be published late today and you will be able to immediately set your Matrix setting there. So they will make it much easier for you, and last but not least, you'll also be able to immediately add your video to different playlists while you upload. So we really hope that improves your work. - Do we launching a ton of features in the next year, which brings me into my next question. How are we thinking about Studio Mobile versus desktop?

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=150) |  Can we expect parity eventually? - Yeah,

this is a really good question, we really want creators to be able to thrive, independently of the surface they choose. So the goal of our team is to bring journey parody to mobile. We are partnering with many different teams to achieve that, but as you might imagine, there are so many things we're doing. So our team is really trying to maximize what we think is most important for you, what you will use most frequently,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=180) |  so that mobile experience will improve as

rapidly as possible. - So given that, what does the team have planned for 2021? - Oh, well we have so many ideas and I think what is great about this general, I love the connection that we have with the creators, and I would really actually like you guys to kinda like help us and vote on a couple of ideas. We would love to do like a small poll after this video, and here are a couple of candidates, I will list for you guys. The first candidate is to bring resolution flows to mobile, so copyrights strikes, brand safety appeals.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=210) |  When you see them, you can see

them in the app. You don't even see them today and you can like appeal on them in the app, so that's the first one. The second one would be more monetization settings, like ad settings, merge membership. The third one would be better commenting functionalities, for example, smart replies, comment, badgers, a better comment dashboard card. The fourth one would be a better dashboard in general, like today it has very few cards the UIs is not optimal, so we can just like improve the whole dashboard.

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=240) |  We were also thinking about like, what's

new in studio entry point where you can like click and see all the latest updates in the app, maybe you think this is helpful. There are three more, one is more analytics, so a better real time report, since published metrics and audience interest cards. Another one, which is more about the navigation, we know there's always the site navigation, which is kinda like a hamburger menu when it clicks it opens. We think it would be easier for you guys,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=270) |  if you could just kinda tap on

the bottom, like have a bottom navigation, quickly switch between analytics, comments and other things. And last but not least, we really feel the app is not driving a lot of motivation, so we're thinking about bringing motivational milestones. So, I mean, if you have other ideas you would love us to bring to the app, let us know, but we will kinda like ask you to vote on these in a post. - Wow, so we have a lot of ideas for 2021  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWutjGF4iiU&t=300) |  and we'd love the CI nation's feedback

on which ones we should prioritize. So personally, I would love to see more analytics, but I'd love to hear what the nation thinks as well. So we'll make sure to leave a poll in our community tab and thanks for coming on the show until next time. Keep it real. - Yeah, thanks a lot Lauren, for having me and thanks everyone for listening and let us know in the comments, what you wanna have on mobile.

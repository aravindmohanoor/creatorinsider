Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context.

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJbGN_nKMpE&t=0) |  - All right, folks, if you've tuned

into The Newsflash, you know what to expect. All the updates you need from the Product and Policy teams here at YouTube in one quick update. Let's get into it. Two launches I wanna make you aware of this week. The first one, very exciting, the fact that we're launching trailers on live streams. Now if you'll remember last year, we introduced trailers, which enabled creators to add a 15 second to three minute clip to the upcoming or scheduled page of a premier. Now we're delighted to announce the trailers

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJbGN_nKMpE&t=30) |  are now available for upcoming and scheduled

live streams from live control room and webcam with the same functionality as premiers. Trailers on live are also gonna be available for channels with 1,000 subscribers, as well as zero strikes. Let us know if you have any feedback in the comments below. Second launch I wanna make you aware of is live chat polls. Now we all know that live interactions are a critical component in both creating as well as watching live streams and premiers

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJbGN_nKMpE&t=60) |  and polls enable creators to both create

and manage polls within this space. Now, once live chat is enabled, the polls will be available in the live chat window. Have fun with these. These were previously only available to a certain number of creators, but as part of this launch, they are available to all creators now Will automatic video captures be available for live streams once the stream is done processing?  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJbGN_nKMpE&t=90) |  And the answer is yes, they can

appear on live videos after the broadcast has ended. So that's it from Creator Insider this week from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators. Let us know if you have any feedback below and we will see you soon, bye-bye.

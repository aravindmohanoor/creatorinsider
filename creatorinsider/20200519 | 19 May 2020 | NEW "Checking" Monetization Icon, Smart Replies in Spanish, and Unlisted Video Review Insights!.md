Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.

there were 38 people who expressed interest in our new experimental feature where we highlight chapter markers and we're hoping to bring more early access features exclusively for the creator insider nation so let us know if getting sneak peeks but not just sneak peeks but early invitations to try out kind of alpha versions of features is something you want more of here on the channel we  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=30) |  think it'll be pretty cool it's something

that's unique to what we can do since we are a channel by the YouTube tech team but let us know if you're interested below and seeing more of that stuff next in April the live team launched the unprocessed live replay editing feature so in the third quarter of 2019 we gave live craters the ability to create highlight videos while streaming while they're actually streaming through the  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=60) |  live control room or from the studio

editor after the live archives were finished processing so this was a tool for live creators to make highlight videos now with the launch of this unprocessed live replay editing in April of this year creators can now create video highlights immediately after ending their live stream using the YouTube studio editor as a creator you'll be able to trim and make video splits to capture the moments you want  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=90) |  to and save them as a new

video while your full livestream archive continues to process so this goes a long way to help live streamers who have long live streams make quality highlight videos of their streams and extend the value of their live content well beyond after the stream is over so let us know in the comments below if you've given any of these things a try and if you have any feedback on how we can make them better this next update comes from the unlisted

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=120) |  video review program which we did a

video about a few weeks ago so Connor from that uvr team is going to share some insights that they're learning from the program and this way everybody out there can benefit from some of the insights that they're gleaning while working on this unlisted video review program for those participating creators everyone I'm Connor I'm an analyst on the YouTube policy team and I'm excited to be here  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=150) |  on creator insider to share some insights

with you from our unlisted video review program today our insights around profanity so broadly speaking most swear words won't have an impact on your monetization with the exception of slurs and if you're wondering what slurs are slurs are derogatory words used against people whether that be individual or groups of people on the basis of their race their religion their sexual orientation that sort of thing what this means is that even videos that  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=180) |  have a significant amount of profanity in

them are generally suitable for monetization and we'll see the green dollar sign what you should pay attention to though is the placement of profanity so we treat the title the thumbnail and the beginning portion of your video which we define is roughly the first 30 seconds or so slightly differently than we put the rest of the video in in those sections we strongly encourage you to keep them clear of strong profanities like or or  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=210) |  the f-word and the same thing goes

for thumbnails and titles the other thing that I'd encourage you to keep an eye out for is the the volume of profanity and the upfront portion of your video so the you know saying the f-word once at the beginning likely wouldn't result in limited ads but saying it like five times in the first 30 seconds probably would so that's our tip for today I'm excited to come back and share some more insights with you next in YouTube studio

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=240) |  we launched the smart replies feature for

English language channels this is the comment text reply suggestion from YouTube studio to help creators respond more easily and quickly to comments we're now excited to announce that that feature will now be available to Spanish channels in the coming week these suggestions can be easily edited before posting so you don't have like the same one over and over kind of tweaked it a little bit and they're based on most commonly-used creator replies that YouTube sees today  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=270) |  we plan to expand the more languages

in the future we know a lot of people really like this feature so we're gonna keep growing it if you have the feature please try it out and let us know what you think okay on May 13th we launched a new monetization icon to indicate when monetization classifiers are still running so during this period if you have a monetized video and the classifier is not done no ads will be  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=300) |  run unless you're a creator with high

accuracy rating insel certification program so if you've been using the self certification program and we've confirmed that your self certifications have been very accurate then we will run ads right away even while the classifiers are still running but if we don't have high rating accuracy from you based on the self certification program no ads will be run while those  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=330) |  classifiers are analyzing the content so this

new checking monetization icon is located directly in YouTube studio to make it clear when a system decision is still in process most creators will not see this icon because our systems are pretty fast one of the reasons why they are so fast is because when people participate in SEL certification and they're accurate it actually improves the accuracy of our automated classifiers so but if you do see the checking icon it usually is going to be

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=360) |  resolved in about 20 minutes at most

it'll take about an hour so keep an eye out and when you see that and you're still an unlisted state let it run make sure you get the monetization state as good as it can be before you flip it to public next we got a lot of great feedback about the quality of the captions on this channel when we did a video about the crowd captions feature and people are saying hey you know the creator insider captions are pretty  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=390) |  pretty bad so we are gonna try

and experiment with improving the quality of English captions we also acknowledge that the do-it-yourself creator captions experienced in studio could be better so stay tuned in the next few months you'll start seeing improvements there and in the meantime for this channel in particular let us know if you think the English subtitles have gotten better usually the professional captioning of  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=420) |  our videos we're gonna try and get

that out about a day or 24 hours after we published so that we can still get the news out as quickly as we can but then also give the caption service some time to polish it off next the Creator Academy launched seven new monetization courses in 28 languages to break up the content to be more modular and targetable the content is designed to address your concerns around the YouTube  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=450) |  Partner Program and increase the adoption of

key monetization options which will help creators like you if you're in the ypp earn as much as possible link below if you want to check out some of those courses and for this week's trivia question if you wanted to get a sense of how active your typical audience is in terms of consuming content on your channel how would you  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuv-1LMaGmc&t=480) |  figure that out and I'll be more

specific let's say you're uploading once a week and you think oh man I should be uploading twice a week or every day how would you find out if your current viewers are consuming a ton of your content on a regular basis so if you know the answer to that question tell me in the comments below first person to guess it correctly will get a shout out keep it real

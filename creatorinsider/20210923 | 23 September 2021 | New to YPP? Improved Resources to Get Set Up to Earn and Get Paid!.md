accomplishment for any growing channel. Right? You've got the subscribers, you've got the watch time, and you're in good standing with the platform. What's next? We've heard it can be a bit overwhelming to know exactly what to do once you get into YPP. So today we're going to talk a little bit more about improvements we've made to the experience to help creators navigate the YouTube partner program with a little bit more confidence. First and foremost, we want to help creators understand how to turn on ads, learn about different ways to earn on the platform, how to see and understand your earnings and how to get paid.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbOuhTk1wlw&t=30) |  To do this, we're introducing a set

of modules in the studio monetization tab to educate creators on what they need to do when they first join YPP. These modules will cover ad basics like different ways to earn, revenue share, and how to receive your first payment, information about the various types of ads, and if ads make sense for your channel. How to earn by engaging with fans through different monetization products like super chat, super stickers, channel memberships, and more. How to understand your estimated earnings and YouTube analytics and your final monthly earnings, and ad sense, and finally how to access

you start getting revenue on YouTube, there are several payment details YPP creators need to provide in order to get paid in ad sense. With the new getting paid module in the studio monetization tab, we'll let you know when this information is needed. This can include verifying your personal information, setting up the form of payment, and submitting your tax information. Even if you're already getting paid, you may still need to provide your tax information to Google as of June of this year. It's important to highlight that there are no guarantees under the YouTube partner agreement about how much or whether you'll be paid.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbOuhTk1wlw&t=90) |  Earnings are generated based on a share

of revenue generated when viewers watch your videos or make a purchase. Your first experience, once in the YouTube partner program should be an exciting one. And we're working to make sure that creators feel like they have the guidance and resources they need to understand how to get started in the program and how to maximize their potential earnings.

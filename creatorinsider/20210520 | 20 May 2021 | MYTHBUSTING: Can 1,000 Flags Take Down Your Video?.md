#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jfj15hJurZs&t=0) |  - Hey guys, Matt Koval here, and

I just met with YouTube's Trust and Safety team and learned some interesting facts when it comes to flagging videos that I thought I'd share. Now, as you probably know, when you watch videos on YouTube, one of the things you can do is help report videos that you think break community guidelines. One thing I learned is that flags don't impact the outcome of a video's policy assessment. Now I asked, "Well, wouldn't a thousand flags set off some kind of alarm?" I mean, surely that means a video is really bad, right?

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jfj15hJurZs&t=30) |  In some cases, yes, and if the

video does violate YouTube guidelines, action is taken as swiftly as possible. That can include age-gating the video, removing it entirely, or even terminating the whole channel. But I also learned that lots of times, viewers flag videos not because they break a policy, but because people just don't like them. In fact, sometimes a video with lots of flags is a result of what the team calls brigading,

tried to gang up on the video in an attempt to take it down, even though it doesn't violate a policy Can they take it down? No. Again, all videos are evaluated under the same policies, no matter how many flags they have. And this is all to make sure that there's no malicious or unfair treatment of someone's piece of content. So, who makes the final call? The ultimate decisions are left to YouTube, who has teams in multiple languages evaluating flags,

zones around the world. If something is borderline or a really tough call, it goes up the chain of command until a final decision is made. (phone vibrating) Yeah. How you doing? Good. No, let's take that one down. I'm kidding. They never ask me. I hope that helps you understand how the flagging system works. I'm encouraging YouTube's policy team to watch the comments of this video, so if you have any thoughtful feedback or ideas,  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jfj15hJurZs&t=120) |  if you ever tried to flag a

video and was confused by something, let them know in the comments. Thanks, and I hope you're well.

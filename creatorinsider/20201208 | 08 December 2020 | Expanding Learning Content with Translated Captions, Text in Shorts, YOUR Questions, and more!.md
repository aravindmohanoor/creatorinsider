Creator Insider is an informal YouTube channel to share information from the YouTube Creator technical team with the wider Creator community. We will feature different people talking about the products they work on and changes we are making so you have more context. Please note this is not an official YouTube channel and is an experiment.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=0) |  - All right, insiders. This is your

weekly newsflash. Your official updates about what's going on on YouTube. Let's get into it. Okay, first up, we have a really exciting experiment. And what this one is intended to do is make learning content more accessible on the platform. So what we'll be doing is supplementing search results in English. We'll be supplementing those search results with results in Arabic, Portuguese, and Italian. Now how we're gonna make sure that this is still accessible  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=30) |  and useful to those who've searched for

something is when they look through the search results they're gonna see automatically translated titles and descriptions in all of those results. And if they select on one of those videos within the results they're gonna have automatic captions. We're gonna start at just with these set of languages. So let us know how you're finding it. We really wanna hear feedback, and if it's successful we'll roll it out to more languages.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=60) |  Okay, next up, we have a really

exciting launch and that is the launch of hashtag landing pages on the main app. Now we talked about this a couple of weeks ago but what we're doing is rolling this out on the main app to 100%. Now, small detail is if you are a user and you're clicking on a hashtag, what you'll be brought to is the hashtag landing page, but it'll be specific to videos which share that hashtag  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=90) |  it won't just be as it previously

was those videos that are related to the topic that the hashtag relates to. So again, more feedback, the better, you know where to put it, comments below or the send feedback link. Next up, we have more shorts muse. That's right, more functionality. If you have the shots camera, what we'll be doing over the next couple of weeks is adding functionality within the camera so that you can add a text overlay to your shorts.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=120) |  Now, this is very similar in terms

of functionality to YouTube stories. So if you've been using YouTube stories, you will see a little bit of a crossover there a little bit of a similarity. Now this is only the beginning. We'll be adding more features over the next couple of months to make sure that we can help you channel your creativity. Now, we are at the stage of the video where we address a specific question from one of you. Now, Lou Pop has put together  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=150) |  a really comprehensive question. It's very long.

And because of the fact that we wanna continue to focus on audience retention, I'm gonna synopsize that question. And you can read it right here in full. But you're looking for that synopsis, it's basically asking Rachel, "What's the right mix of videos to upload to my channel so that the algorithm doesn't give up on the channel itself." And Rachel replied, "Hey there. So glad you're so deeply about how to design content for your audience.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=180) |  Our recommendation system is designed more on

the video level than the channel level, paying most attention to how each video performs when it's offered to viewers in their recommendations." If one video doesn't do well, it likely won't hurt the performance of your feature videos unless viewers are consistently ignoring your videos when they're offered to them on home or suggested. So to avoid this scenario, you try spreading out the uploads  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwhrp7lNH30&t=210) |  of these different video types. So Lou

Pop, thanks so much for that question. We're eager for the next question. We bring each one of these to the team that can provide the best answer in YouTube. So from the creators of YouTube to YouTube creators this has been Creator Insider your newsflash official updates about what's happening on the platform, and your opportunity to provide feedback to the people who can make those changes. Tune in next week. Thanks so much.

week to talk about the advertiser-friendly content guidelines. So, this week we're gonna be going through incendiary and demeaning as a guideline. So, what is this actually talking about? Well, it's content that is gratuitously, incendiary, inflammatory, or demeaning is not suitable for advertising. Now, this is an interesting one because of the fact that this specific guideline isn't called out as a separate section within self-certification.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oAXtD3rKbo&t=30) |  The reason for that is, for simplicity

sake, we're combining the hateful guidelines with the incendiary and demeaning guidelines. So, something that is allow ads, limited ads or no ads across these two guidelines will be fine within each one of those buckets under hateful content within self-certification. It's pretty complicated. So, make sure you leave us any questions in the comments below and we'll address them. But as you look at the advertiser-friendly content guidelines page, you're gonna see that the layout is a little bit different.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oAXtD3rKbo&t=60) |  So, instead of breaking in out under

self-certification and through that framework, we're providing examples to give you some color. Now, the first thing that always comes to mind when I think about incendiary and demeaning as a guideline is distracts, there huge part of YouTube and they're not necessarily brand unsafe or unsuitable for advertising. It really depends on the context tone and who is the focus of the distract itself or what is the focus.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oAXtD3rKbo&t=90) |  But the things to watch out for,

if you're trying to buy for that green icon and as much about monetization revenue as possible are two separate areas, content that focuses on shaming or insulting an individual or group. The second category is content that harasses, intimidates, or bullies an individual or group of individuals. Now the line between, you know, bullying and harassment on just light-hearted mocking is always a difficult one

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oAXtD3rKbo&t=120) |  but it's really, really important that you

focus on making sure that it's the light-hearted mocking. If you want that green icon, now, examples of stuff that's gonna be yellow icon would be content that singles out someone for abuse or harassment. Content that suggests a tragic event did not happen or the victims or the families or actors known as crisis actors, or that they've been complicit in a coverup of the event in question. Lastly, a malicious personal attacks,  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oAXtD3rKbo&t=150) |  slander or defamation are all things that

are gonna get you that yellow icon. So, as ever, we're on a quest to make this as transparent as we possibly can. So, make sure you leave us some feedback in the comments below and we'll do our best to make it as clear as possible. I've been your host for today, Connor, and we'll see you on next week's news flash.
